he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . "	4.769325928129992
he came to tell mr . gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .	3.4017333775982146
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs . gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	2.8308575796841464
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .	2.908083336213202
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . "	2.2994804764424823
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr . collins , in describing the civility of mr . and mrs . philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .	2.211346900345461
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	2.5848798927783037
is not it so , mrs .	5.520491193724016
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . "	2.512760940240351
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	2.51274228669461
elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	2.7769736246132353
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	2.6254025344533063
good bye . "	7.90316407503424
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr . collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	2.4565565810182517
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .	2.3459666211618604
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "	3.2427294206785136
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .	4.092415415290364
i enquired after their brother , of course .	4.786623750509675
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	3.2142110644613147
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	3.1178082628734423
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .	2.609412873621801
" good god !	9.38846640750871
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts . "	2.9173112306233953
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	2.419920314412162
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	3.7017642660448082
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . "	4.018400777081199
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . bingley will like it lizzy . "	2.8754553449993074
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	2.3508742829962346
this was agreed to , and mrs . philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	2.609040318844147
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr . bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	2.447373849336308
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	2.5372813232553577
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	3.4849017230687545
such a disappointment !	10.72674986022486
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "	3.5605643879027595
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	2.7539788975822383
so much the better .	6.040653490369067
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ; and while mr . darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	2.31646893834776
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "	2.364594620252501
the strangeness of mr . collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	2.856749386275107
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! "	2.792500798977484
" you write uncommonly fast . "	4.056526365443985
a few days after this visit , mr . bingley called again , and alone .	4.661389905118637
" _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ .	3.0677811552943495
" but does lydia know nothing of this ?	3.7555639037789224
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr . wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	2.4947697340395254
" no , i believe not . "	5.069117297747067
this is the estimation in which you hold me !	3.7649241715483197
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	2.2824712176994035
one morning , about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	2.492254149017882
" i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	2.8029623057929696
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr . wickham with money . "	3.414916856716166
" you may depend upon my not mentioning it . "	2.7924722826644066
mr . gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .	2.243320452380976
" i beg your pardon .	4.6079847099948354
" his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . darcy's steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself . "	2.8390217093879606
there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr . darcy could have such boundless influence .	3.1616835077689798
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	2.6604900758963597
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	3.2800379849671355
one must speak a little , you know .	4.734986387655868
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	3.0078932377880383
who would have thought it !	5.741704026641342
" mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them .	3.080028074691398
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	2.2527695726411188
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "	4.039478547477592
" no , not at all . "	4.138928598503331
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	2.2786575128806934
" his misfortunes ! "	6.506904165865945
" i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "	2.8600693171653835
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	2.5362972092275915
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	2.6080325155380946
but it must not , shall not be .	5.9214450278866595
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	2.6423952483167494
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation ( and you ! )	2.07913556357646
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	2.729018215884509
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain . "	2.338085338383396
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away .	2.0528998628409143
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	3.2967593738575474
she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "	2.9477112363487565
" i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "	2.685486819214622
mrs . gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	2.6159914960052872
you refuse , then , to oblige me .	4.513200392264398
" some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know . "	4.213067276688496
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	2.6776176524638453
but i knew i should persuade you at last .	3.6844606978929666
it is from my cousin , mr . collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "	3.080982164740925
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient .	4.798242133227269
the old lady is mrs . jenkinson , who lives with them .	3.0557103076178906
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs . collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	2.6875435711705014
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in . "	3.2537908118606707
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	1.9713299461993554
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	2.9743356889544534
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	2.005610589766391
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .	2.6873551188051
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	2.8208463665842354
what has she to do with it ?	4.5662048739428736
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	3.0575470267968856
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	1.871593855967513
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	2.4837812360925144
" i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . "	2.102634468687598
" nearly three weeks . "	4.9028549941670985
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that .	2.6419917313868955
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	2.605024120032127
" it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .	3.7170593479303453
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	2.9218845715100086
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "	2.4798876237175844
" i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "	3.0603203519442443
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	2.441297905369426
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	2.330914957455257
" nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	3.698990340277859
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	2.1221483044300986
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	3.564082376082046
" after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	2.2505811984877986
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "	3.5667498060692835

first of all , he asked miss lucas .	4.890400835644525
" in what an amiable light does this place him ! "	2.788183651729777
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	3.0187440479485064
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good .	3.1614898793648467
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	5.128610025703878
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	2.1761381895332144
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr . darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your's .	2.8173006394604445
two days after mr . bennet's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . "	2.641740647967712
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "	2.7896528474452484
catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .	3.0906764430113487
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn . "	4.026753199748259
why must their marriage be private ?	4.439624364217435
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "	3.0748251908748525
mrs . hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	2.7131095563815566
" i am perfectly convinced by it that mr . darcy has no defect .	3.8778264614088576
chapter xvi .	12.028774447866011
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .	3.3714792752170397
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	2.5577112497564363
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and mr . bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	2.3859369371734074
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .	3.4586090511931715

at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . "	2.373950756620959
" very true , indeed;--and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "	2.2616987103722996

" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life---- " mrs . philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	2.636576949984074
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	2.4276812674946338
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	3.456121188092259

mr . bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	2.451501053265298
" you must not blame my aunt .	4.530971803538373
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	2.5855497271805308

" it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "	2.9406900062697443
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	2.1701332392480133
sir william only smiled .	6.639772872618996
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .	3.9152549060756408
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	2.963895491868569
" and my mother--how is she ?	4.2624072509463105
till this moment , i never knew myself . "	4.318100626249302
" good heavens ! "	5.984350366591534
come be quick , be quick !	4.811753833469123
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	3.1144108728817304
" who do you mean , my dear ?	6.224950784720483
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	3.100595385986624
" did mr . darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "	3.6171061544300596
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .	4.102137802474394
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	4.4021609959466055
" indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	2.966831350911547
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	3.077039677889005
he added , that mr . bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon .	3.7546506183093142
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	2.310406469245115
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "	2.70970831512282
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister .	3.9123776200339777
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	2.0628264593076264
it was all conjecture . "	5.504380100486925
said he , with a look of doubt .	5.790543373666267
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .	2.591620382069707
mr . philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	2.7347436961868214
" upon my word , " said mrs . gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	3.486345916519125
though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	3.074034302856676
but that is not the case _here_ .	5.9631791097632565
what is it you are talking of ?	4.256665787287022
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	3.065093991705246
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn .	2.453399358974348
mrs . bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	2.3026080792489236
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	2.717043757685893
" she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley .	3.9928465700516744
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .	2.9818649897136593
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "	2.997265864745378
yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .	4.918027608583846
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "	2.7447050274666513
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	2.5057164882401146
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	3.7271376034043886
lydia's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	2.5132670965241632
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states .	2.625156943781019
his words seemed to imply it .	4.4571623833108385
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	2.726886785978727
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about . "	3.907013358219021
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	2.3433578356493467
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	3.745256956531078
mr . darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	2.8318077972182567
international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states .	1.9898881738094065
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .	3.4901234323119654
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .	3.294494541991079
" to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	2.3975548673823788
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . collins's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "	2.327109406004632
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence . "	3.202309911171217
perhaps i am not doing her justice .	5.921139923030859
_he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	2.6672887786517374
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "	2.4648092055867967
" indeed ! "	7.197480626426112
and she rose as she spoke .	5.756004491453152
this accounted to elizabeth for mr . wickham's being among them .	3.868025196016282
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	2.6588233602202624
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	2.7821506049297406
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?	2.425296549446671
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	3.868779781708784
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr . collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr . bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2.5611590671907782
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	2.5187278184860205
" yes , almost every day . "	3.4798956140876744
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . "	2.781468729781474
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	2.7924717087775592
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .	3.6990076566593695
mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	2.2850111113497182
with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . "	2.9450449026949963
chapter x .	12.028774447866011
" the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	1.8912578269808937
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	2.161931782017732
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	2.339845048835786
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .	3.7159606383728363
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	2.3973366083440726
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	2.471591928998031
" and this is always the way with him , " she added.--"whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	2.873636694101345
" it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend .	2.0549138741304995
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire .	2.978562557276591
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	2.8631669933684902
" you are a good girl ; " he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	3.3815066520059998
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	2.1513394819840057
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	2.4709186321706174
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?	2.6941356215133276
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . darcy's sister , as , by wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	2.7083860191359865
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	2.8271537894169643
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	2.205547723558112
in the hall they parted .	6.8787813930919555
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	2.9217673859803175
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	3.676270534215291
mr . wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	2.695923512264053
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs . bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	2.8863666851310716
and his sisters are charming women .	5.568800024965455
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first , i should be completely in your way;--and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire . "	1.972131410077133
chapter vi .	12.028774447866011
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says .	3.220849717445469
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . "	3.8575725965964334
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane .	2.916502392859333
" you know nothing of the matter .	4.923962906923392
let her go then .	8.235404173049357
mr . darcy bowed .	8.20996107830847
" he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only . "	3.1060202415462705
his sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	1.9291817278025316
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "	2.060498241768931
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ . "	3.2066783486147132
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	2.4297770039837845
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	2.615022326713714
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" it is a long time , mr . bingley , since you went away , " said mrs . bennet .	4.092356490556533
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "	2.727374646239553
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	2.377551631015826
" lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say .	5.590759342225516
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	2.6468874885459
give me farther particulars .	7.558852172692139
see paragraph 1.e below .	6.516032615855677
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then observed , " your father's estate is entailed on mr . collins , i think .	2.3410454614088807
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "	2.5720655739097817
" oh !	5.461298269298178
on mr . and mrs . gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	2.9481078022787295
" compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	2.481788702015817
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	3.4428035650554647
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character . "	2.623421495806757
but mr . gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	2.591512698484852
mrs . jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	2.165381243112377
" what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "	2.7296899387181774
" yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	3.846466995876439
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	3.0153001557618566
society , i own , is necessary to me .	3.8648828571567515
" but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy .	3.0665747986298797
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	2.3359865833282325
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay .	3.1273184763795085
" you have said quite enough , madam .	3.6668203015711747
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . "	3.048819323471512
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .	2.7774499876247503
i know how much you dislike him . "	3.9610096682516787
" and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good , " added kitty .	3.0238649617423126
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child .	2.7676629406781013
his disposition must be dreadful . "	4.841397370042075
mr . bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	2.4754103393060407
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , " i am not . "	3.400598015831442
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "	3.179364674344096
" could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife ? "	2.9561674756144845
i do not know who is good enough for him . "	3.305697473810134
" by all means , " cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .	2.523145525830591
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	2.3087519685699265
as mrs . gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr . bennet came from it .	3.7947848172743086
they walked on , without knowing in what direction .	4.397107031747409
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .	4.110806092522307
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	2.6387754825524925
" certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	2.6805988278130277
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	3.2283349453775836
chapter xvi .	12.028774447866011
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "	3.036034817721563
this is your final resolve !	5.762098456274982
" yes , and i had heard it before .	4.367251629462935
and , above all things , keep mr . bennet from fighting .	3.665990326289185
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	3.672510743882157
yet he is _such_ a man ! "	4.2829329285177655
* * * * * mr . gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	3.2094016736777156
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	3.196176296168324
" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "	2.9019833778207
one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	1.8175442996188063
" your's , &c . " this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	2.419148350318393
no one but mrs . bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	2.6940059676487307
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	2.736006348214737
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	2.9611405537547486
but you are always giving _her_ the preference . "	3.617056264250717
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	2.7038409565945276
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	2.3451221737187944
elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	3.109646679805454
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "	3.5794161942035516
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . bingley might like you the best of the party . "	2.620611104382472
" of what are you talking ? "	4.5609369612571635
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	2.358523794542785
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	2.9074204839010505
mr . darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . bingley never stirs without him . "	2.247422710179036
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	2.780737063814585
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	3.063907655530273
" my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "	2.277366199149452
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	3.210042720931757
wickham's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia's for him .	3.0337440126930457
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance.--mr .	2.4929109877293754
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done .	3.020517776403584
mr . darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	3.663547009280517
he was very fond of them . "	4.996456964670261
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	3.5892032128539846
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	2.9234813851064763
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .	2.562053436679461
you are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself . "	3.542001924715312
mr . collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	2.9637081689318987
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	3.07157756868163
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs . bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	3.348213089514545
" you forget that i have made no answer .	4.389204859434345
hang kitty !	19.63578548279658
only look at her .	8.58871802992237
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	2.219230613704071
their fortune on both sides is splendid .	4.0841646396512274
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	2.697423782642283
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	2.568999038930652
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	2.1024023274637234
i could hardly keep my countenance .	4.710968579510677
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .	3.320602833874425
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet . "	3.6765470142201253
mr . darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	2.934484606211281
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	4.362767788714877
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs . f . but no one can throw any blame on them .	2.772171654511028
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	2.1741837836815177
mr . bennet replied that he had not .	7.06084034074345
but however insincere _you_ may choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so .	3.0141742920370143
and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	2.395397315840437
he was on one side of her mother .	4.693539798128691
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	3.8681129790455073
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	2.59816299125002
miss bingley i am sure cannot .	7.017534808335388
i will have no reserves from _you_ . "	3.8740487285958745
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "	2.1033917011606325
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	3.620193601135537
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	3.525138097325598
" oh ! "	3.5762404981170763
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	3.222768154601866
we will go round the park every day .	4.1378041034794055
" why will you think so ?	5.441746039753808
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	3.3979731276603617
on this subject , what can you have to say ?	4.239264360845232
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	2.719315489212386
very well .	21.870419758446847
" well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose .	4.016959837838385
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	5.799376259393596
after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	2.3443114886686756
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	2.511690187892784
well , he is a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	3.1115065099195593
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window--she looked,--she saw mr . darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	3.101690729895582
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .	3.2505369673791167
" i did not think you would;--and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion . "	2.703671874745251
" not so hasty , if you please .	4.658613736127639
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	3.556611258298978
lydia , my love , ring the bell .	4.554514499286412
" has your governess left you ? "	3.549824884280837
" in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "	2.9903382907898397
i must find mr . gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . "	2.7995608477513936
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "	2.656374579035697
if mr . darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	2.8875208071875256
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	2.3866883104706624
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh !	2.655442536159917
" _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza , " said charlotte .	3.4902041745122765
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .	3.7489935000110717
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr .	3.0213060001752847
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	2.5887975212839165
mr . gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	3.211511934559629
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	2.3796459861515675
mr . darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	3.81679897304971
a person may be proud without being vain .	3.7619145684215565
you must not disappoint your father . "	4.1946169749195725
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr . darcy !	4.5211650702092845
i am quite well .	8.861171475252675
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	2.2010902692757996
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	3.0709066761532715
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . "	3.4943256620686
poor dear child !	10.253622808499633
it is useless to talk of it . "	3.8858181710092077
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	2.444124346014851
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .	5.311665834673415
mrs . bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	2.7630827254869215
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns .	1.8647653210847785
hear me in silence .	7.968640161335312
" do you prefer reading to cards ? "	3.2482808692176914
" care of him!--yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	2.4167497414695043
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	2.366376187414064
" i do not believe a word of it , my dear .	4.520674030470243
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "	2.605891256948874
" neglect !	18.7668733945215
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "	2.2513271380295925
" if one could but go to brighton ! "	3.1237093867268384
jane was by no means better .	6.21144744180012
mr . collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	3.7561316819674238
" my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "	3.5464964095048988
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	2.483667341895521
no , no , you shall not deceive me .	4.006624731488445
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	3.5750215099915286
" oh , lord !	6.120605980639009
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	2.9535903208473067
" i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town . "	2.6711278109828545
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	3.051307731657178
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .	2.703395342954672
_that_ abominable mr .	9.293121961746452
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .	2.4133983940133588
" but the wife of mr . darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "	2.658332530842764
" well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to-morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	2.9726857221517755
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .	2.787164698499079
mrs . collins knew not what to make of him .	3.8014622322316223
wretched , wretched , mistake ! "	4.305339157657754
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	2.43382816583821
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	2.5177698183952826
certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	2.3775158919960737
i thought i should have broke my heart . "	3.8368436816639044
" i wish it may . "	4.7774330830316
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "	3.02908676274748
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .	3.5214614890357487
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged .	2.903116475587269
thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	2.4962655547724237
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr . darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	2.5587041173443503
yours ever , " caroline bingley . "	4.051429926395667
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .	2.590188660909242
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	4.516349767570737
" insolent girl ! "	6.099983075180996
but we are all liable to error .	4.519552300511587
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; " who can it be ? "	3.6213739381334333
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	2.947822450590298
in three volumes .	6.8269562414459894
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	3.4447672921350145
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	2.9406597746490037
oh !	22.329577332847695
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	2.193785481224964
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .	2.9096526426758214
this will never do . "	5.491613455067718
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "	2.604517946995318

by tea-time however the dose had been enough , and mr . bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	2.766344591313008
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ?	2.8344545068364364
" oh !	5.461298269298178
what hours of transport we shall spend !	3.861877956479498
i was never more annoyed !	5.627670230624414
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	3.736656436208827
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	2.1907255287894567
bennet . "	19.071496075473426
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	3.9201606663049433
on saturday he came again .	5.67900839514473
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .	2.7458826862207015
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	2.8090624173172163
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "	2.308206133096608
and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma'am , do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr .	2.891545264144052
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin .	2.185655233630161

" does that young lady know mr .	3.978905720489195
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	2.4932679916583824
" there can be no doubt of that .	4.73406894375697
it originated in mrs . gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	2.5484104021531246
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	2.295696811008779
" lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	2.8880741889182575
and is it really true ?	5.879353438089095
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	2.573399691746368
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2.5243130409829555
" and is this all ? "	4.305155488648216
when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	2.492758912427719
there is nothing else to be done .	5.7607693000290405
the business was therefore soon settled .	4.801699573789302
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	2.6315871635099457
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _them_ .	3.3171789781446783
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "	2.5549812309606463
it is really too distressing .	5.2708800775827305
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . reynolds was of no trifling nature .	3.163044184681596
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr . collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	2.720275988734734
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	2.9167781007465408
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "	3.0727921319263496
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party .	3.2173194034051327
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .	3.1499111613380726
no . "	18.16795063265939
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . and mrs . gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .	2.92699859126898
" i think she will .	6.0254365611536524
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .	3.543260718502768
" do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? "	2.623281377521593
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	2.4155903632283158
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	3.730441566653472
chapter iv .	12.028774447866011
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	2.5623394775364816
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	2.844498369264037
" oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland . "	2.3949699550554744
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	2.7747261297051704
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	2.4980877427294574
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	5.522518020177507
it is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	2.6229937973434923
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "	2.4302532263930834
" as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ .	3.211135858792263
but , really , i know not what to say .	4.643024806133575
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	3.812426719727184
" la !	13.786655412364652
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	2.7108294996118856
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height , or rather taller . "	2.527752680369653
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	2.726952326307072
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr . darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ .	2.448617576019623
chapter iii .	13.82411919814114
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged mr . collins's conversation to herself .	2.751641344770219
you must come and make lizzy marry mr . collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ . "	2.935467370238592
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .	4.150118571212502
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	2.524665458798318
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	2.8089152770934396
" bingley . "	9.157131001235648
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that mr . darcy could be so unworthy of mr . bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	2.374453342397611
" and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body . "	2.483289462670013
" she is a very fine-looking woman !	4.419229889742547
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .	3.9166814620472636
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr .	2.575641787874506

" i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	2.309687428016364
" john told us mr . darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? "	2.838653150696609
" to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you . "	2.431711700631717
i will take care of myself , and of mr . wickham too .	5.826288149154628
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	2.7331245497528296
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	2.4521200604240407
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	2.7571867376025443
charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where mrs . bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	2.436024766917159
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	2.595052735265031
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	2.3545508927746375
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	2.916179791288296
" miss bingley told me , " said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	3.2787280141085384
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	3.076366272873531
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "	4.11292653878753
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "	2.3344674919482444
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	2.919950644100119
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	3.612473561581815
" oh !	5.461298269298178
a lively imagination soon settled it all .	4.133867304217454
what is the matter ? "	6.644969087057107
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions .	2.58916194921405
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	2.267032864040837
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	3.4422558519408826
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	2.7282699179570726
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	2.7271321584368975
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .	2.5204593104450987
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	3.3228308921976777
" your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .	3.1691240956790456
" my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .	3.312381325504443
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	4.416450087341189
" a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	2.3480682038342953
" i am trying to make it out . "	3.589544828559545
mrs . bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	2.2044806223234255
" that is to say , you had given your permission .	4.185114293610089
it is admirable ! "	6.232179540566032
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	2.2833197700416363
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening .	2.6029912638519184
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "	3.122718012914496
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	3.424360877080115
" with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "	2.6063710782263048
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	3.9544705493210524
" no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "	3.430796338246607
you must and shall be married by a special licence .	3.068892268403592
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	2.685778542922566
cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	3.503708850970188
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr . darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	2.422705591319497
" yes , very different .	5.260673508108632
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	2.41057591275885
" it must not be thought of .	5.032894847576766
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable .	3.350768217316075

ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .	3.544219698085877
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .	2.425775714128529
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . "	2.7616663470739473
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	2.5631303036658974

" you begin to comprehend me , do you ? "	3.3465832124694277
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	2.9126550820162707
mr . darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	2.497451206197773
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her .	2.865276603672477

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	2.418599005494123
" you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr . bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	3.818361869926266
do not repeat what i then said .	4.307325149108889
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	2.8369411210018107
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "	2.357201275199713
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	2.564401519980839
repeated miss bingley .	11.098570546768308
" exceed their income !	6.74990090749597
mr . darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	2.7783719212303746
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	2.9937317535919346
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	3.4652936496984448
she repeated .	19.156284599176047
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .	4.40150251562517
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	2.6058383523682815
miss darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	2.6728271875577505
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !	3.588782477035099
" because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "	2.825652544497853
" and have you heard from him often ? "	3.5739520687392705
mr . collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .	2.400513975024617
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	3.2423355418065447
but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself . "	2.371872743774507
" they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "	3.259428387963881
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	3.24953152678896
" that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth .	3.4473812056766517
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .	2.6750429413973116
we were married , you know , at st . clement's , because wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	2.9449505225176438
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? "	2.1764148962216208
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	2.5505502324541087
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	2.5286996186407658
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	2.5264507599609973
did she call to refuse her consent ? "	3.433843677232503
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	2.71625995321988
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever . "	2.2883948642899803
cried he .	18.244733686016975
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	2.2774618286738786
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy .	2.0865282895366644

" it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . "	3.346900466170133
he was well , but so much engaged with mr . darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	4.050584170351131

no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	2.2356499360807396

as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	2.6373330171027005
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	2.8431911169648
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	2.727306194168216
it was mr . collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	2.6733615415241254
a few weeks , he believed .	5.855167034250818
" upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--pray , what is your age ? "	2.68557261983628
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	3.0071543454867813
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	3.318340639467509
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr . darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	3.5974641224923563
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	3.36808920074649
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . "	2.85218788154376
now is your time .	7.773722558267578
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	2.1151154974420923
" and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "	2.8939198142708906
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	2.8772766734116253
sir william had been delighted with him .	3.9150289068509534
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "	3.2306354071888594
" are they indeed ? "	4.741799283013092
mr . gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	4.2669125295932036
how was that possible ?	7.406094675466557
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter .	3.0905887713052174
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ?	3.9976011419752195
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	2.111296813373185
her own thoughts were employing her .	4.478478252717048
do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .	2.1308218636969998
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	2.222098775969675
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?	3.0345324208936466
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .	3.5326641531605993
imprudent as a marriage between mr . wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .	2.4026294982084946
" certainly , sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can dance . "	1.9687364877449873
i will only add , god bless you .	3.3034886937138896
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .	3.0921072989568392
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . "	2.3601924028131323
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	2.9085104209452175
i quite detest the man . "	4.2107583903754655
the second began .	10.794264831019438
you tear them to pieces . "	4.172492239056358
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	2.2968954579744123
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .	2.712197573012793
" i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .	3.8263138053835872
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	3.1973027185479332
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	2.6239582295676653
" my dear father , i congratulate you . "	3.5354970964105776
" i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him . "	3.1361942522160526
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	2.911429570167335
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	2.7801958657129635
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	1.9055918969977064
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane .	3.204079117055419
" you are uniformly charming ! "	4.073199455188051
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?	2.6699190755801534
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "	3.697214689223003
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well . "	2.875424740713769
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	2.491863092478671
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	3.2804388630729937
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	3.0599056477862896
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	2.7843690632037954
" i never saw a more promising inclination .	3.839226653164262
it must be my uncle's doings !	5.483323224471934
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew what he was .	2.887050743879338
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "	2.3933636718264135
mr . bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . bingley .	3.946266671988541
" i should not be surprised , " said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "	3.672799973498403
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	5.072990740015332
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	3.292903355471281
oh , lizzy !	11.18870892067256
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	2.4823547645429684
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet .	2.2194565018478323
darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right .	5.089710536116874
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "	2.6594560300688865
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr . bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit .	2.555109133282386
on the following monday , mrs . bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .	3.050464716407249
smiles decked the face of mrs . bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	2.748335664431434
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .	3.148425971914897
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals . "	2.052116921103368
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	2.3386278449580935
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "	3.5195131956614563
" oh !	5.461298269298178
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	3.109777686901719
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	4.012751549038221
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	2.5883696535632645
chapter xiii .	12.028774447866011
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "	3.070909304274559
" oh !	5.461298269298178
elizabeth was forced to go .	6.49453499368633
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .	2.6058984748649543
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "	2.633364657056878
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . darcy looked up .	3.297519951195482
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations .	4.155002809708157
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . wickham .	3.0118865555183265
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	2.645639223886064
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .	4.250544572950248
she will make him a very proper wife . "	3.7579415844268387
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	3.3493613623572696
what congratulations will then flow in !	4.338186451246205
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .	3.3781811961917905
" you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "	2.8006668970311805
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	2.8607396422572045
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	3.0925526108821226
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "	2.838355080432349
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .	2.844685115920997
" did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ?	3.399991735897264
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	3.2860565890662423
but she would not be secure .	7.121690722008064
i am sick of them all .	5.32537513106849
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .	2.9002897775433545
but , lizzy !	10.157617717017743
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . "	2.4374922450007634
only think !	19.54472730912327
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "	2.7370190374826064
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	3.5372678161793925
" ten thousand pounds !	9.09980583826252
collins ! "	18.385640191756632
console lady catherine as well as you can .	5.715342447475812
miss bingley was engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	2.4535211737744165
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	2.442361757319643
" speak to lizzy about it yourself .	4.050662590237061
said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . "	4.143354338753967
during dinner , mr . bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	2.3785797909876454
" can you come to-morrow ? "	4.094467373455835
" that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	2.8325278727568275
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch .	3.6373150636247074
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . philips's .	2.8276259003780067
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	2.6246265839323675
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .	3.901800152697883
" but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? "	2.767479696015755
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	2.5571372337724334
" and this is your real opinion !	4.377184026770656
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "	2.578747518624657
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	2.8903810577925095
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "	3.3470038240635973
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's . "	3.1351657959199337
i shall be back by dinner . "	4.138720398470256
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	2.8540487567042097
" well , then--supposing them to be in london .	4.341661048727595
mrs . gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	2.2341881568907893
" how despicably have i acted ! "	3.575500136714219
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	3.5095788918652526
those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "	3.3446254722476083
oh , brother , how kind you are !	3.961898955364781
general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works .	4.65726372007842
i think i have heard you say that you know them . "	3.547344556568342
it was lady catherine de bourgh .	5.507433462817909
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "	2.5178056825219306
mrs . collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	2.7909970395681163
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "	2.906511342185326
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . "	4.650782417904333
mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	2.9174243627446157
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well .	2.423417502695589
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .	2.993872324361542
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	2.4655057693821036
--it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	4.392379195376945
" to-morrow fortnight . "	6.140248740635587
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say .	4.377071891719683
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	3.079275705545496
" with my mother up stairs .	4.570687325102342
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . "	2.8110804857703195
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it .	2.886029068730864
good or bad ? "	6.402138071535774
but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	2.614278644528103
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king .	2.491854394668021
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .	3.3776486231109337
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "	2.2705911981947167
mrs . philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire .	2.6716686452121845
you have done all this !	7.5824258036395
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced . "	4.522691089111061
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane--one does not often see any body better looking .	2.908415025539686
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? "	3.009152563451961
" la ! "	7.184969235417607
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	2.816105141738613
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "	2.7338076732940446
chapter xix .	12.028774447866011
" it must have been his sister's doing .	4.645563687824852
such doings discomposed mr . bennet exceedingly .	6.0430019076657295
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr .	2.7905471448930093
while sir william was with them , mr . collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	2.322106778893021
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .	3.592248908972318
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	2.4138595488991292
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr . collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands .	2.5572292393843004
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	2.5227564120486905
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	2.4188001384491002
i _will_ leave him to himself . "	3.718533332079258
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	3.1067668907600217
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	2.171630021182675
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart .	2.2913507098991968
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	4.034143839405388
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	2.4798201098026023
" i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	2.664710041343481
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	2.4777412511576777
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened .	5.620436255915758
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties .	2.6209062575918773
it will not do .	11.451280265541918
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	2.2752275950014034
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .	3.555031853867188
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .	2.471842506636728
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	3.07941189853439
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "	3.5301395350836446
stay , stay , i will go myself .	5.558178547758038
" do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa , you will not mind my waking mr .	3.0613060844227427
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "	2.506984492067341
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due . "	2.9232002280128504
" i should like it beyond any thing ! "	3.228439488006416
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	3.4937518214598997
is not he a charming man ?	5.3315568122770145
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . wickham , and rejoiced in it .	3.666647408181453
she will be taken good care of .	4.264757063245473
" are you not diverted ? "	4.157368956656312
i am not at all afraid of her dying .	4.322583454026797
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? "	2.9843438004731047
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .	2.109231433133236
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to .	2.527983600362329
she is almost three and twenty !	4.524413573535535
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she .	4.084294796536518
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	2.199330399196121
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	2.6898363429055965
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	2.403755975914216
in as short a time as mr . collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	2.4829572533971156
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	3.0401292222235177
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	3.7935370318027726
" perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .	4.1030891046094
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	2.3855254882608983
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed .	2.736563678205631
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	4.472165082677874
said her mother .	14.834659427625496
" one of them does . "	5.289270911893252
she has known him only a fortnight .	4.149244695944932
" and have you answered the letter ? "	3.4333669997751457
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .	4.857415166291689
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs . gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	2.8832943170805216
on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	2.478882538074816
" no , " replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	4.459032618648543
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	2.222882173454566
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	2.7289755863642733
" if i , " said mr . collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	2.3073423862507823
my dear , " continued mrs . bennet , " i am quite delighted with him .	4.63370654159566
my dear mr . bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	3.5487954931334715
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	2.205644656973555
jane looked at her doubtingly .	7.522882228043635
brother-in-law of wickham !	11.107508801151507
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	2.3614052511938044
" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried .	4.151523169062615
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "	2.8979836771011134
" you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth .	4.020468080504565
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	2.693252392138648
" i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly .	4.0518266515296455
she is quite a little creature .	5.265617638838312
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment , now quartered in the north .	2.5931894644986935
1813 .	41.088003610396605
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .	2.361515247712273
" i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice .	3.621069835854255
very nonsensical to come at all !	5.165267676462205
she shall hear my opinion . "	4.485805870645591
" yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . "	2.5088809224965227
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	3.218812199801466
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	3.5272225461148023
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr . wickham's attentions .	2.9415772024268256
" true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	2.646952780904506
you do not know what i suffer . "	4.95912652343238
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	2.021389133415249
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	2.9564814522079947
the moral will be perfectly fair .	4.679866076291573
certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "	3.051813334195072
mrs . bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	2.8093791666029433
you have delighted us long enough .	4.560705165515635
my reasons for believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	2.141186418573403
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	3.1189966755854686
" i never can be thankful , mr . bennet , for any thing about the entail .	3.912225780949169
" now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table .	3.148240796417749
" you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .	3.6868128923898027
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	3.0379438151482376
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	3.0741928954919304
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	2.511465760018207
" remember , eliza , that he does not know jane's disposition as you do . "	3.889107384609982
the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	2.966975374507406
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .	3.258299051983712
" all!--what , all five out at once ?	3.4233906602338244
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .	3.184176845244291
" but it is , " returned she ; " for mrs . long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "	3.256213031338558
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "	2.330424658354874
oh !	22.329577332847695
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure .	6.656672699283891
poor little lizzy !	10.276463405171983
there was no want of discourse .	5.454147194423001
" elizabeth , you are not serious now . "	4.8596425987952765
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	2.4646136870279847
unfeeling , selfish girl !	6.756444732952849
section 1 .	19.241648418762324
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "	2.2913654675556736
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .	4.207150863552878
you do not look well .	6.161570629581034
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .	2.0207282657018273
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	2.2649490275160984
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	2.231585410819813
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs . bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for . "	3.390024269094727
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .	2.9500166090723514
chapter viii .	13.866366423968332
" my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london . "	2.9569580037850205
" i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .	3.5332068257866887
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . "	2.1094434616024516
mr . darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party .	2.2494689276212827
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .	3.7510094344301876
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " lydia declared herself satisfied .	2.780938077257052
" i never thought mr . darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do . "	2.99726621668968
added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "	3.2011399091212698
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	2.016015911963335
mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted .	3.408440481094486
" mrs . annesley is with her .	4.748813298943481
mrs . bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	2.58437972341652
i did not think mrs . gardiner was so little to be trusted . "	3.7350711098220186
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .	3.2695653736883292
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "	2.3038099140859534
mrs . bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	2.321848333054494
elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	3.9923018105847143
" my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	3.355422799836269
four nieces of mrs . jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	2.9122636539959355
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	2.6089783789510865
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .	2.9263166170791193
mrs . gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	2.1615150755268258
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	2.8376272894878274
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !	4.07189063895055
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	2.7765123396035842
" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	3.1368152921807977
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	2.4354616245997485
the following sentence , with active links to , or other immediate access to , the full project gutenberg-tm license must appear prominently whenever any copy of a project gutenberg-tm work ( any work on which the phrase " project gutenberg " appears , or with which the phrase " project gutenberg " is associated ) is accessed , displayed , performed , viewed , copied or distributed : this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .	1.659169779514122
mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	2.66696644629837
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	3.0724147424498076
" i dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "	3.46209648820905
but she had no reason to fear mr . and mrs . gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .	3.433093915282907
and to see dear wickham too !	4.968613992794249
" if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "	2.6321857662371846
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	2.6133485403365517
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	3.5146550515399464
mr . wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr . collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	2.8865073656599907
" then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . bingley to _her_ . "	3.773473897966887
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr . wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	2.1643729151638955
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	2.2499378407136184
women fancy admiration means more than it does . "	3.2633791257985854
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	2.3808515574527225
" i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "	3.1405902898648623
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	3.030133993822568
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	2.9929643115764555
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	4.087418828638752
what am i to do ? "	4.785246799110805
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth .	2.8421873772533037
mrs . bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	2.173043601709773
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .	4.57496551131934
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	2.1518149950225527
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .	2.9704688194983886
before any answer could arrive from mr . collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .	2.9314654075489712
miss lucas is married and settled .	4.411742368389839
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	2.357995467131014
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .	2.533347808924179
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr . darcy .	2.8224231519535716
no , no , this is not likely .	5.837088858257188
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	2.1963208411004698
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	3.5970742992784883
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !	3.2741288016135086
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	2.4307629768434094
how can mr . bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	3.0878172805413495
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	2.2831496589086258
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows:-- " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	2.332493751288682
but i dare not hope it .	5.6238499169269325
" yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "	2.550225411873946
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .	3.16378139050897
he placed himself by her .	5.565549444209855
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection . "	2.5533145720060526
is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "	2.917608959991481
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible .	2.1928949387068215
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	2.8107799057887375
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	3.4926931802724672
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "	3.5194953731837577
bennet ? "	18.758266883414386
" thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	3.100137247707426
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	2.3500468723845382
mr . darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	4.241041995594851
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	2.3029386874445446
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	4.933139496546118
mrs . hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	2.4502673909342607
" as soon as ever mr . bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs . bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "	3.833031440326559
it seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	2.225255498507868
" i am sure i shall break _mine_ , " said lydia .	4.112313626753206
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	2.442588579522914
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	2.908281505192092
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	2.2771905386387696
he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "	2.277593378720796
jane now came up .	6.994323574087581
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go--and , at another word , might stay a month . "	2.2761725091536626
my father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	2.367949199029771
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "	2.455383359868139
" a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever . "	2.5306695310783263
" gracechurch-street , sept . 6 .	4.038093560840814
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them .	2.5634718676999126
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .	3.128897831357178
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	2.3486701027558765
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "	2.43927042563408
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . "	2.7416591653931794
" oh !	5.461298269298178
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	2.275766982002144
ten thousand a year !	7.971840747455316
" you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	2.7939164508182532
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .	3.08182033158097
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library . "	2.587130889237622
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	2.990516522933895
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	3.3429499872775374
have you heard from my uncle ? "	4.488109111757363
" yes , there can ; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it ? "	2.422278057205982
occupied in observing mr . bingley's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	3.0580790001373765
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--here you are in your own family . "	2.419691154080258
mr . darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	3.202678615904145
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	3.4407903714465142
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr .	2.9973346641996894
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	2.8701668947332815
you see how continually we are engaged there .	3.6556622852756955
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	2.6314325789488997
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	3.011569582452826
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success .	2.3913421218829654
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "	3.084636820421138
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	3.198300443158203
" are you quite sure , ma'am?--is not there a little mistake ? "	2.6522993924521763
" i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .	2.6417197474417704
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "	2.281247652762538
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . "	3.0076978524153017
" she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	2.749286197042629
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	2.1488066058140567
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "	3.328927682004924
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .	2.5029661092345536

" oh !	5.461298269298178
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	2.6653146227065334
" miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , " despises cards .	4.3622666250155655
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	3.627239152633537
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	3.2710177200175816
cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened ! "	2.611975739623619
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me . "	2.379282206416973
who attended to you ?	7.786017358900157
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .	2.3994556187995606
" you are quite right .	5.510241787351212
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "	2.969372817978964
mrs . bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	2.5703524382833507
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .	4.012712282893242
" can i have the carriage ? "	5.389620592287656
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income .	3.610302966171847
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .	2.4128516788737326
" oh !	5.461298269298178
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company .	3.2833465725457027
i am ashamed of you !	5.541361513480824
[ illustration : matlock ] pride and prejudice : a novel .	2.47834343410595
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	2.0496097246546365
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	2.680110447924977
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	2.8187621769550315
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	2.194876201656252
what say you , mary ?	6.455946636882928
" i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	3.134649717314742
all this was acknowledged to mrs . gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--"i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	2.5382075197700247
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	2.367663535779183
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	2.2526622413999458
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .	3.3741157075803545
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" has she been presented ?	6.316417100068883
in a few minutes , mrs . bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "	3.386679546674569
darcy mentioned his letter .	7.230901491962914
this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	2.584085573990504
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .	3.215935649083108
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	2.4326290497119665
" it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to think . "	2.898292448636322
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	2.9132619226890095
i shall see her in january .	5.1252813471248295
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	4.57274874840914

chapter xviii .	18.01069171588611
mr . collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	2.7671936222125906
had the late mr . darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life .	2.4833162118583307
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	2.768967643101139
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	2.4968718750043264
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "	2.492641833326031
mr . collins then returned to elizabeth .	4.565352655743128
nobody can tell what i suffer!--but it is always so .	3.3171787391531087
" yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	3.3570229169006627
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "	2.6189693583816918
the dejection was almost universal .	5.31877991831159
" _i_ never saw such a woman .	5.040087801731258
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	2.8917918375219314
he cannot know what mr . darcy is . "	5.311518069445629
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	3.7360605904425284
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "	3.167262699797438
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . darcy and herself .	2.3386066303499615
and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh !	2.8145515209168024
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	2.7449078847531885
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	2.728850874466692
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	2.3152180741372153
" of music !	10.48926719731962
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	2.3133443970267473
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .	2.965404786880964
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	3.327003710207803
" that is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	3.310011307351299
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	2.7521559998516043
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	2.218386885121923
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	2.280848853016423
" yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "	2.783045960626887
* * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	2.0694851191620645
well !	71.08292525730101
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .	2.8849598888642416
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he .	3.7792213112527353
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse . "	3.3525350447901467
" he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam .	3.9155673338061114
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	2.2442723673285756
" are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "	2.469109012989607
chapter i . elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	2.349165157734033
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	3.3415417513825534
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	2.523221571765993

" good heaven !	7.670509370426284
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "	2.499722403247704
well , any friend of mr . bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "	2.545946526530647

the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	2.7240241749635943
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	2.0904678056102775
chapter ix .	12.028774447866011
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	2.9799950592513964
i knew that mr . wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	5.97092890944276
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	2.4910270750022656

i don't know .	9.655536372523475
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh . "	2.7388311887073895
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	2.0390083712753544
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	2.3845763393966277
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	3.6259761116928098
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months .	3.0149632696315902
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	2.3198426125807776
" this is not to be borne .	6.037200015988223
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .	3.413516512521514
i did not know before , that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony .	3.4519870073336585
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too .	3.540683157073874
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?	5.19420537132001
" nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility .	3.7147183333327485
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone .	2.180605527850599
they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "	3.035098033415441
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	2.9799451624171005
_i_ did for you .	7.206676181728011
there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say . "	2.961319924903879
" his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	2.93700935767751
" i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr . bennet .	3.839288344374004
mr . gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	2.993735781182099
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	2.599292204026311
he is gone to my father already .	4.611373280421609
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "	3.0456487790239675
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	2.5090919246876147
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	3.108198900538036
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .	6.053494621717362
" oh !	5.461298269298178
there is nothing he would not do for her . "	4.124427273977461
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	2.368120316554169
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ .	3.025127044017643
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr . bingley--is not he ?	3.368944542152401
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can,--or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away . "	2.210094128337198
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	3.7864098280893774
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	2.603215784601248
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	3.7497843874371903
let me hear from you very soon .	4.127356769727867
chapter xxiii .	18.01069171588611
" i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think . "	3.0373856830839183
i do not trust my own partiality .	4.547037450370142
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	2.1507594422822165
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	2.1956974433251357
" unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . "	2.815467345535672
he should be particularly happy at any time , &c . &c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	2.447479458007674
she will be down in a moment i dare say . "	4.108046873660308
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	2.723896666411425
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	2.6403027970441566
" and i have another favour to ask .	4.368279422079161
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs . gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	3.0963693654377873
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr . bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	3.002464660367005
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	2.3519783462235195
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	3.6541935133948567
but that is nothing to us .	5.877898149062441
and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "	2.688693153168936
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	2.385703202080038
" except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate . "	3.4434895920865993
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . darcy .	2.3761148513294463
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr . darcy with a very expressive smile .	3.2294005998926485
" but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .	2.8697632709025407
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection.--he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning.--the part which i acted , is now to be explained.--his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice.--i described , and enforced them earnestly.--but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	1.91428720855169
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	2.9538299665711945
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !	2.662450774610416
" i will make no promise of the kind . "	3.104965579285245
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	2.4624763853513825
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr . bingley her sister's being in town .	3.165086395423261
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	3.0894115034035345
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	3.1856564757769408
elizabeth replied that it was .	9.01344919731469
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	2.41716196446428
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	2.107158251338543
limited warranty , disclaimer of damages - except for the " right of replacement or refund " described in paragraph 1.f.3 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark , and any other party distributing a project gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement , disclaim all liability to you for damages , costs and expenses , including legal fees .	1.9193623181723758
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	3.087389395311306
" _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness !	3.3529016545777073
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .	2.9298598854550466
pride and prejudice : a novel .	3.6437092134114466
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .	3.933049289914338
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl's younger son ?	2.777326355780945
chapter xv .	12.028774447866011
1.e.8 .	77.2072484543645
why was he to be the judge ? "	4.629258732914512
mrs . collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	2.8564402134309193
but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	2.8163745470236607
when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	2.61845051610065
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "	2.78167595738304
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr .	2.283859988572957
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr . collins's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go--saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . "	2.497056349264624
" perhaps we might be deceived . "	4.107316437849335
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr . darcy might have done as well . "	2.6734217759106964
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	2.174325828037565
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . "	2.6878687335932723
it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .	3.51818816121032
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	4.699711197520063
" it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "	2.5045073103085813
elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	2.9903024690044977
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr . bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	2.7789047845560164
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . darcy , " she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	2.941832193061274
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	4.982047509641761
elizabeth had settled it that mr . darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	2.7816611825670137
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr . darcy .	3.559697612269644
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	2.588988300633753
perhaps he thought her too young .	4.959301672137459
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into . "	2.7763532381207296
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	1.7773440505411902
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	2.679808971960615
mrs . bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .	2.5382671920432873
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	3.1964256206393635
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	2.526098318818282
1.f.5 .	75.27981737932598
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ?	3.2457053505403053
elizabeth smiled .	18.776043000143062
in a few days mr . bingley returned mr . bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	3.3245566996354805
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	2.371822057918821
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam .	5.417493565169807
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	3.528870864592691
" i am not now to learn , " replied mr . collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	2.4483224644338852
" oh !	5.461298269298178
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater--what shall i call it ?	3.028653926179442
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	4.364008648423245
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	3.8635074419733475
" but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "	2.665739042302037
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give .	2.2180743496508333
" upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "	2.412351607144021
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	3.2605578904644865
" let us sit down .	5.819260413166237
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "	3.3032421596829127
you give me fresh life and vigour .	4.096759074412449
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	2.1802947591771673
jane shook her head .	7.073811696260385
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	2.421391469500155
darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "	2.572965727788873
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house .	2.999591782832927
he arranges the business just as he pleases . "	3.297262973608668
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance .	2.536725197594095
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	3.3024587813891424
my friend has an excellent understanding--though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	2.8315406811855928
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	3.1471213368693287
they were ignorant , idle , and vain .	3.7070315711252255
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	3.153983562444094
he has heartily forgiven me now . "	3.570500159161212
little more than half a day's journey .	4.804074529811877
i mend pens remarkably well . "	3.971438363625683
" something very much to the purpose of course .	4.622359396704247
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	3.221800024693532
" oh !	5.461298269298178
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	3.5026794141263875
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	2.549260471483039
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .	2.2999907959780983
" you are severe on us . "	3.899321068994488
" what will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are !	3.2083639059226305
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .	2.5093946171668886
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	2.315811829467006
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	2.1847045369944067
mr . bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	2.5029699557757112
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	3.1745803004888535
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	2.3065255511764033
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	2.465455237748956
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	2.421712165448865
if this be the case , he deserves you .	4.135107765437266
how i long to see her !	5.538505922348986
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .	3.046502052371945
chapter ii .	13.82411919814114
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .	3.406961591306009
from what can it proceed ?	5.968971535271004
her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	2.5419944999724193
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	3.2452247587824936
it was gratitude.--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	2.226506272077949
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "	2.214826059649364
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	2.4208305263007235
we neither of us perform to strangers . "	3.411918183081562

there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king .	3.5446445882956454
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	3.1852314709767433
mrs . gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .	3.697515373876511

but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud.--as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	2.5874378734915235
" i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth .	2.79111505753505
their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	2.631469076992301
mrs . bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! "	2.850548814645383
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	2.257419530825313
" impossible , mr . bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "	3.4443810726639135
well , how pleased i am !	4.713865089819609
" my uncle is to send a servant for us . "	3.156995896109577
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness.--mr .	2.9363642744274907
we had better not mention it .	5.147886004865815
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	2.7085924983441156
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	3.391761557851235
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	3.324117334323352
" oh ! "	3.5762404981170763
" upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself . "	2.269492542244213
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .	2.6740114520529943
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	3.308352966614376

i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	3.1330937772857994
i do think mrs . long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . "	2.4410031785586574
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	2.9722287117036266
my father , however , is partial to mr . wickham .	6.158531946148925
why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	2.841836362638175
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day . "	2.6772027823527336
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .	3.927925905373075
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	2.6573774884771333
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .	3.5743464584963442
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	3.745050337948791
at that moment , she cared for no other .	3.9842529452453963
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .	2.589175537352619
mrs . bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last.'	3.9019423063537464
my dear charlotte,--impossible ! "	6.208278107415905
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "	3.3888266170962824
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , " come , mr . wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	2.822602235494833
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . bingley !	3.097133808130326
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .	3.2882549116127398
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	4.636695791074692
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	2.37070012769834
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	3.2182466947390522
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	2.482249830333461
that tall , proud man . "	4.201679219013529
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .	3.708134391049608
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	2.2903326540472446
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .	2.964551016715506
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	2.423916958027409
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance . "	3.3651943622314184
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	2.2254884453891677
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	2.614547524436327
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! "	3.193437891864679
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	2.2535578363895583
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	3.9439402543296245
younger sons cannot marry where they like . "	3.5419812221469353
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . and mrs . collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too .	2.3684248569820343
" from mr . collins !	11.021382009847594
her answer was warmly in his favour .	4.521645001817202
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings . "	2.332980012214744

do you often dance at st .	4.323699311625319
" yes ; to the last .	5.969515818433868
and his answering immediately to the last question--oh !	4.221995545539515
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	2.6754680464229947
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	2.361961145394112
yes .	71.37678631148695
indeed he has no improper pride .	4.636305542663874
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	2.150625881217753
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	2.7326726713978964
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	3.216839204079032
i dare say the lace upon mrs . hurst's gown---- " here she was interrupted again .	2.385011902599605
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	6.123366073267688
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "	2.4293333918588753
" it is well .	7.726456076870342
what do i not owe you !	4.444284367234137
chapter vii .	12.028774447866011
she was ashamed to think how much .	4.616575467724264
what is it about ?	7.878253099634573
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	2.3891722468875654
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	2.30126894132866
mr . collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	3.2719828691172532
you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him . "	2.937889167618628
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	4.044000010989761
what a contrast between him and his friend !	4.447221914121915
" no--why should he ?	6.337788621291794
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	2.4415538763815143
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante . "	3.5630709772285134
" may we take my uncle's letter to read to her ? "	2.696932203569566
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .	3.916651317948602
" i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	2.9812503992378763
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	2.795834798976356
but when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	2.0708933637916593
your's , &c . " edw .	4.718548565859735
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	2.85872020133622
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	2.9891803277826803
never , since reading jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her .	2.5877786769020927
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "	2.4816925521432998
darcy said very little , and mr . hurst nothing at all .	4.236229295189017
she answered him with cold civility .	4.486310961968794
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	2.481821291718431
mrs . bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger !	3.6234033123008116
how shall i bear so much happiness ! "	3.487422502836638
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . darcy they had only seen at church .	3.409779239118035
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	1.9313382809956166
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	2.904857029864168
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? "	3.5459696921442383
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	2.664664758758424
he had never had the slightest suspicion .	4.7868097894353605
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	2.0645187177624527
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you .	3.0134774023570734
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	2.7729831119277244
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .	3.005062818932546
good gracious !	19.187397813482054
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	2.517334807286901
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr . collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . bennet were dead .	2.7667736865555117
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence . "	2.5360375206334833
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	3.1695338098542094
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? "	3.025679053856971
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	3.068777778812862
heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ?	4.54309506768682
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them . "	3.7391469853176287
indeed , mr . darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . "	2.3287991873908735
this was very amiable , but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	2.165400840288384
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	2.5126292276265283
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	3.5541563669786336
but mr . bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	2.2508242337424487
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	3.267055513769495
all was joy and kindness .	5.692620806819723
i had not believed it possible . "	4.514397474128905
1.e.5 .	75.27981737932598
elizabeth was delighted .	10.134928936879799
mamma would like to go too of all things !	4.150501026849252
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	2.8796716287396236
it is unaccountable !	9.116326926549936
a small sum could not do all this . "	3.543143678634495
the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . darcy could not have .	2.4897949686228604
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	2.4672427498043534
he has children of his own , and may have more .	4.766855543098456
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .	2.3982167709650373
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	2.1936207794381355
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	3.800777774715676
" oh , yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .	2.7571727786448337
mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	2.9463754657012236
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs . collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	2.7134304175831394
make haste , make haste .	6.919716139093201
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	2.6937677103092343
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	2.5916678707193004
he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	2.733376341491066
" i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	3.3530131851857004
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them . "	2.461911829193673
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	2.9496874067829237
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	3.6843252681126613
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	2.5911111885544273
mrs . bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .	1.9842514352850469
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	2.420342100078466
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "	2.517489053594853
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	2.6442379474247097
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	3.6585566925960378
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "	2.238440056309074
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .	3.538382367128224
his character is thereby complete . "	4.18492285572514

our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .

i _must_ have employment and society .	4.0976022088794695
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings .	2.959018540478482
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	2.653670503275459

he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	3.0052870956153632
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "	2.6369797159288844
" not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "	2.560437883629894
we do not suffer by _accident_ .	4.62402895490264
" well , well , and so mr . bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs . philips first brought her the news . )	3.037150415890618
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "	3.042375319207635
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	2.397427605014233
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	2.312032065466542
" yes , or i will never see her again . "	2.9550930395424793
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr .	3.008994589706488
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley's continued absence .	3.3636034683074363
mr . darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	2.7516545970957056
" and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ? "	2.468245890175926
but you do not know _all_ .	7.7948029307389435
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go .	3.4989287005695497
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "	3.1091834588408322
her figure was elegant , and she walked well;--but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	2.831568532006515
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	2.8685869305347835
" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "	2.8028362396957016
" and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "	2.618692110211144
they were all astonished ; and mr . bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir?--you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . "	2.386165996026558
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	3.066105561440181
" will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at present i have not room to do them justice . "	2.458512214588002
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr . darcy had been staying there .	2.6197039050874094
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	2.378610290765883
" but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "	2.3402030770972386
" she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "	3.0526328532415086

upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . "	4.347013497582556
mr . darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , mr . darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself . "	2.3177055013677923
mrs . bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	2.896446341878062
'ah !	75.49401523612455
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "	2.9420342993226813
" indeed i am .	7.197289498174776
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	5.210363919014468
they must be a great loss to _your_ family . "	3.572027658866336
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	2.8253800899293684
collins must excuse me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	3.152664849235181
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .	4.603972576820448
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	2.744408523277159
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	3.1173125770582635
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .	3.130818714420219
her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	3.6703781257583663
darcy_ , you see , is the man !	5.238142022285709
i am not romantic you know .	4.834527910322125
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr .	4.317744796018499
family pride , and _filial_ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	2.869689205821073
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	2.3956209172761644
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	2.548395769193685
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	3.6655648173241846
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .	2.0586196403451344

but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .	2.322989155668921
and what can _he_ have to say ? "	3.713500148947968
_that_ is all to be forgot .	4.989907855637438
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	3.345239534410479
" believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .	2.3104125470974144

" there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "	2.2675446744187386
it was over at last however .	4.577375556176641
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came , and mrs . bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	2.5891871728248406
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	2.876610948214436
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .	3.0881718558299114
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet .	3.1160572576800614
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .	2.4815247581050315
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "	2.2656179828172855
" perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?	2.60681261522973
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	2.4106655998782327
mrs . hill began instantly to express her joy .	3.778864541946384

sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	2.2699874395854076
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	3.8763216290993765
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .	2.8361278510931
" it did .	9.959306220956085
" i can much more easily believe mr . bingley's being imposed on , than that mr . wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it be not so , let mr . darcy contradict it .	2.3157696708480993
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr . darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home .	2.9589027403165535
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "	2.668933964601569

[ illustration : morning dress .	4.6981330766320095
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	2.3672496376931953
he has also _brotherly_ pride , which with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "	2.2205480263414046
they are gone off together from brighton .	3.9471576902428467
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	2.529999783823203
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	5.391003013723879
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	2.9816944091601454
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? "	2.819288339197445
" ah !	11.918701760586288
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	2.570591114016558
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law . "	2.8493881065502804
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	2.836596406769545
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	2.7740689694807443
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable . "	3.6071492880415907

but don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	3.2064926480456357
mr . darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .	2.426522518813698
" i hope not . "	5.022469906981837
but the case is this .	6.023467532877066
mr . gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	2.282336795679209
very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	2.6745874814748207
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane's . "	2.9532142899201737
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "	2.3085846889016075
" it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas .	3.5956711266706973
i shall like it of all things .	4.867799364670764
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .	2.774781114394398
my dear , dear lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet ! "	3.031372522314818
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .	2.2456780082801013
" the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "	3.4008463261798103
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	2.4827612336208222
his most particular friend , you see by jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	2.6312113076616432
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	2.3858474564733454
" no , indeed .	6.882493223334626
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	3.006379197993051
darcy ? "	14.087842819634524
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .	3.601969469161428
" can you deny that you have done it ? "	3.8881539321704506
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	3.064064164757712
" nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	2.9888155284770845
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . "	2.6358436927856523
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr . bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	2.362235180983981
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	3.040286475653101
so much the man of fashion !	5.369589072036407
" is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "	3.3967090499284214
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . and mrs . gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	2.9292429235952877
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	2.4732962390678352
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "	3.340920822919592
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?	4.5896820344330305
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	2.6489382565515434
mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	2.027323368755603
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .	2.7721751421559815
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .	3.3562909854586036
" oh !	5.461298269298178
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	3.7115860116121806
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	3.0309518611307533
i thought we never should have got into the coach .	3.341691944463038
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "	3.143602324961487
you know my sentiments . "	5.455450440732982
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	2.702907351866214
" how i long to see her again !	4.328403809016183
" it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ . "	2.8697355842691756
" colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	2.376919462961837
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "	2.7652193443890516
" oh !	5.461298269298178
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can.--daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	2.35690718253418
i will think no more about him . "	3.5191068670011982
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	2.7726110600422222
mrs . reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	3.0086748574869104
" my dear , you flatter me .	4.267580235606494
" i should imagine not . "	3.9703129884700328
mrs . bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	2.862044835310963
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "	2.6247838241240604
my feelings in every respect forbid it .	4.788545761715823
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice .	2.0243230362972833
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	2.5947957878709187
" i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , " said he .	3.2863109070937924
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	3.215192532228287
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .	3.422558887346036
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	2.3275835957427944
she has two nieces of her own .	5.201247403606939
her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "	3.2613310624263954
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "	3.286419661937444

the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	2.266670557119623
we passed each other several times .	4.465887008596635
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	3.6148316246774033
" he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	3.3871874487151725
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here . "	3.8449640552458795
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	2.7297033492577603
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "	3.6725196786890946
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	2.984294076049859
" it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "	2.9087001837471553
darcy ? "	14.087842819634524
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that mr . jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better .	3.134945310761504
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "	2.8474435601798485
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "	2.396855427801974
the loo table , however , did not appear .	5.9720683869164795
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	2.7267376634290925
she had a sister married to a mr . philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .	2.8080109363226198
" yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	2.6334599359141353
chapter viii .	13.866366423968332
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	2.7274005061841287
after a short silence , the lady first spoke .	3.8363921988179124
" well , lizzy , " said mrs . bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane's ?	3.3027387284374696
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	2.9508564875095953
mr . collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	2.0989842286383036
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her-- " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "	2.316885663641745
" _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said mr . darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet .	3.551512907428866
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "	3.819332577300972

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house .	3.3317936831586765
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	2.569988293924485
" my dear , dear lydia ! "	4.099977058611741
lord !	69.28932527861664
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	3.6012897345897508
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? "	3.185260329285381
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	4.220811218731881
but so they always are .	5.49650469752545
he heard her with astonishment .	5.209106675109305
if elizabeth , when mr . darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	3.2393881429906215
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	3.31323180010634
" no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "	3.4483706117557045
can it be really so !	6.874583337007936
hurst . "	19.67561715310552
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	4.555284263640032
on both sides it was only assertion .	5.216266825864421
" from the former .	7.297417147905904
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "	2.400373923332251
" yes , she did . "	5.264839939181351
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street . "	3.3223773020605454
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	2.123567319877577
these recollections will not do at all .	5.0928726473466455
they had long wished to see him .	4.978908405396912
in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .	2.937430782971858
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	2.3888733660526866
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	2.01565022672858
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .	3.171660258580213
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy !	2.682325325823587
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	2.1192715469026107
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	2.820432746990616
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	3.283137497435341
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	2.7240339348752527
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	2.7274374998565016
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "	2.5835170273232086
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	3.1296729250504796
i ought not to have said a word about it .	3.631437178342415
" mr . darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling .	4.480693945154201
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	1.9566701899869605
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	3.1952998748160537
dear me !	20.62362867655912
your sister i also watched.--her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error .	2.2078996731513363
cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted .	6.416888376672356
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	2.708559126041513
" my dear jane ! "	5.353624376653794
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	3.568815275623586
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	3.0467530243619634
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the trouble of practising .	3.363604167762897
mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .	2.6060703201391933
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton ?	2.544056600615694
" i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	3.6463690739311465
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	3.926244142117039
" true , " said mr . bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "	2.864509341905133
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	2.2906627740369427
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	3.6498796149075807
i cannot understand it .	7.438593766195654
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	2.223193812518075
bingley.--but--good lord !	18.88620510351571
but now it comes out . "	4.057602882869942
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	3.630115936513513
vol .	50.62194450838858
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ . "	2.827986775569402
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "	3.872434562734308
what could she mean by it ?	4.820818710106574
" yes--if darcy does not put it off again .	3.5190096949280583
chapter xxii .	18.01069171588611
" she is a most charming young lady indeed .	4.05368031877295
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ .	2.454528282706766
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	2.5084469992741867
" yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor . "	2.6643746343194703
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	4.516563225239696
it must be an amusing study . "	4.674329123628065
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "	3.2383097278772524
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty .	2.5531764213772727
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr . darcy .	2.3954875020156776
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "	3.364910625448989
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	2.7059369195371707
mr . and mrs . gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy.--though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr . and mrs . gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	2.1603241836038043
" oh!--you mean jane , i suppose--because he danced with her twice .	3.0143811055998255
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	3.9514128104495536
in three volumes .	6.8269562414459894
could she have seen half as much love in mr . darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	3.5183500487679096
had it been your uncle's doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	2.3235839545555237
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	2.787427661933926
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "	2.6411209637380253
we seem to have been designed for each other . "	3.7226486428629753
" i am sick of mr . bingley , " cried his wife .	5.113983760863572
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .	2.4218249652617265
'lady catherine,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure.'	4.084333973330486
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	2.883920890493434
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	2.358169146482771
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	5.686202187299808
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	2.8074446636915154
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . "	3.959255076137582
the other is miss de bourgh .	5.932771430389122
when the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	2.4521373260851846
mary and kitty , thank heaven !	5.143336375666719
but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	2.6675697987301827
mr . darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .	3.3132681378665017
" i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	2.9352575095706657
" and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? "	3.0088389585678255
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him .	3.981044958650832
" i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	2.817454410165192
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "	2.2039727156859477
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	2.54811054101192
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me .	3.3494587355041845
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	3.6770546300174214
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	4.173636472379492
mr . darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life !	2.598447156760278
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	2.6237383652717186
" neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	3.0446585568746363
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	3.6504979714725616
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . "	2.8303287656146936
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	3.3810519611910705
but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	2.24105575171827
" pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "	2.773917271548269
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .	2.381816169717395
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	3.7648048429387635
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	2.4267925780680497
she longed to see mrs . philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs . wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs . hill and the two housemaids .	2.8672212568480537
chapter vii .	12.028774447866011
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	2.507242225628436
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	2.5251194108181623
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	3.420029634714606
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	2.6810873260914243
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	2.4141136124593787
how can it affect them ? "	4.304190148111439
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .	3.7113734658927773
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !	3.618352184994865
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .	3.2381710555576197
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he _did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr .	2.226569487084072
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	3.3816535855006333
let wickham be _your_ man .	5.043670176282205
lady catherine seemed resigned .	6.855922292218993
but , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	3.220564101071224
but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	2.312570702051108
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr . collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr . collins and me have a little conversation together . "	2.9009568835251307
" and do you impute it to either of those ? "	2.841159823122886
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "	2.369074077108571
have you had any flirting ?	5.880289159320325
yes;--there is nothing in that .	6.680656451412198
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	2.3243579890465793
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "	3.2041743789110226
my fingers wait your orders . "	4.049983728726738
" how should you have liked making sermons ? "	3.266911749816092
" _you_ were mr . bingley's first choice . "	3.82064820168603
mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	2.6701951002529194
bingley . "	17.187200086062816
nothing could console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her resentment .	2.398736532491793
" it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	3.234687575415985
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	2.9235992557318986
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "	2.8224684563463187
" oh !	5.461298269298178
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	2.745991527315557
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	2.5015636094870017
she will follow wherever lydia leads .	4.185781140158256
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr . wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	2.917320970432837
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	2.92549565056863
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .	2.704490823817204
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .	2.849456123664504

" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	2.6524567120243647
" you have a house in town , i conclude ? "	3.660034936501492
a lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	2.3145919193838362

other schemes too came into her head .	4.065215611813596
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	1.9684244512666393
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	2.3303201284851216
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution . "	2.7083923056799435
i cannot quite agree with you _there_ .	3.9182807541994427
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "	3.5231611520679618
said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i'm the tallest . "	2.888151447331308
how i wanted you ! "	5.139442537116828
what relates to yourself , is as follows .	3.6493685704533587
" a great deal of good management , depend upon it .	3.6722937570793146
" mr . collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	2.4990488765682
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .	2.533636177574687
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . was not a man to be trusted .	2.5430939478193184
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	2.0321029497765166
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	2.8389898006013956
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	2.01980055860715
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	2.3329035220555925
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . wickham and herself .	3.7483926617221046
_that_ is all settled . "	5.905955019447303
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	2.572505170127894
cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !	3.1279793594294887
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us .	2.9477394103048296
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .	2.301775445204984
" oh !	5.461298269298178
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	3.2519743748248584
" no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	3.902425384786245
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	2.1591163551541506
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	3.1987793154558526
mrs . bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	3.6440911930919904
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs . jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	2.3985404885733286
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .	2.98001733239058
yes , yes .	11.562927542128715
" mr . collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "	2.7174564784820623
said she , as she looked in her face .	6.280982592192936
who should suffer but myself ?	5.656835737371825
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	2.2018177586711665
" and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?	3.3283979482779933
repeated mr . bennet .	13.14903263270421
my father bears it better .	5.261923034647665
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .	2.7733411309488387
is it true ? "	6.763969070392243
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . "	2.449511010727956
" we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "	3.198192069420747
but at length , by elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	2.495129966985307
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "	3.275400382935346
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "	4.1053548909423725
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	3.686112720372922
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	3.1345140623852954
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married .	4.715157075289342
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	3.0558397447647394
" i admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "	2.351472658100228
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . "	3.140650091596977
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	2.5030506796837257
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence .	2.7747749091434657
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	3.297468347015179
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	2.291670444996075
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? "	3.116268576228027
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	2.6147285802112363
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	3.380349601867124
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "	2.2755198732709023
how odious i should think them ! "	4.447894922881998
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	2.4129909146243764
her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	2.7135273547071614
" oh !	5.461298269298178
it would have been strange if they had .	4.514820128373148
chapter xix .	12.028774447866011
" it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .	3.2342344439747808
" that is very true , " said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .	3.4393835965279607
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	3.563744759856012
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	2.792460953358339
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	2.880499520941183
elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	2.325813232037781
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	2.644273755919005
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	3.589424787664649
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	2.4934667433564703
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	2.1701640888394755
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	3.541838118645443
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	3.7112937374436528
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?	4.591130783918721
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	4.156756302279767
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton .	2.438288827965769
without a governess you must have been neglected . "	4.392576147400327
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	2.37232194060247
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	2.581136930997217
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	2.5786760795939117
-- " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .	4.185057982742711
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	2.677462596078113
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	2.3195890197254037
how unlucky !	20.952986022255647
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	2.2470313958563497
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr .	2.9549703839378543
but it is all , all too late now . "	4.030176360551581
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	2.925998374545608
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "	2.445062378279464
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	2.852308670828351
[ illustration : a vicarage house . ]	3.5700034045448765
" if i were as rich as mr . darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was .	3.276311247990427
arguments are too much like disputes .	5.1265539735125945
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing . "	3.228274065859411

why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more . "	2.8994501625758065
mrs . gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .	2.5383230103115935
the project gutenberg ebook , pride and prejudice , by jane austen , edited by r . w . ( robert william ) chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .	1.6984979839612981
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable .	3.3288714283597587
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	2.086975511870688
but it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .	2.702583859085323
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	2.2799562253410186
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	2.3314552892666485
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?	3.39380527381586
jane was not happy .	7.2618628255001365
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	3.318289199136365
" they will join me early to-morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr . bingley and his sisters . "	2.494874367808994
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	4.344140394089681
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	3.3662064451616427
" yours , &c . " as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	2.237556061412663
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	2.2833973269940175
" oh , yes!--if one could but go to brighton !	2.9616372994603197
" obstinate , headstrong girl !	4.910660627492542
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	2.781249579115899
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	2.2891469229248806
mr . wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	2.829172519446117
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?	3.82661192953026
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	2.2497815113842683
collins . "	14.743375941726718
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs . gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes . "	3.286886963425207
bingley will not be detained in london by them . "	3.8523608772399416
" oh ! "	3.5762404981170763
" that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had--not turned out well .	3.556270042660099
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	2.9128589485251215
the first week of their return was soon gone .	3.4894396059429678
can i speak plainer ?	7.531749673582433
" take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "	2.588310411628269
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .	3.492924659270985
--said jane as she finished it .	5.291284082647815
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .	2.896544341167556
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	3.8143548482872607
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs . collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	3.01110262245548
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	4.372239586425798
she dared not even mention that gentleman .	4.219316808859494
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .	3.7812256997090374
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance .	2.9384021392192605
" you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . "	3.1407643651620663
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	1.9608943192906967
" this account then is what he has received from mr . darcy .	3.674926356375259
make haste , and come down this moment . "	3.3328567415764536
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	3.2540181663169463
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	3.1581435997997405
she practises very constantly . "	4.776306078226613
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again . "	3.3465069603862374
" most willingly . "	6.276983326975424
" certainly , " replied elizabeth--"there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ .	4.035938400113851
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her .	4.298568556928587
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	2.5577349874341975
but perhaps mr . bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "	2.621829134477472
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce .	3.1428942617065263
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .	2.987326921754405
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret .	2.8084597160456077
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .	3.6729715919381816
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs . hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am ! "	2.2380131184631775
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address .	2.495170857270013
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart , the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark .	2.0470390944984893
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	3.229375946315454
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could . "	2.4312798052930593
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	3.6433631204863484
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .	2.260661928670442
besides , there was truth in his looks . "	4.22619669527686
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	3.2098406321878072
" my object _then_ , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	2.528621649032175
" this is wholly unexpected .	5.130790445953773
" your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	3.1378117282689226
" they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "	2.4136264539963674
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	2.059361555457521
" but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	3.3431163832887054
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	3.024286791872776
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	2.2904408096263893
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr . darcy .	4.139691013039201
but papa is so disagreeable . "	4.371929486956382
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	1.9802675358909376
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	2.480225181669045
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .	2.5532810014779352
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	2.743459871809663
darcy ! "	12.301447857731699
" if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	3.1288879287200544
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	2.5650177398459766
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	2.9353071909555446
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	2.029584818783868
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	3.255252065808526
he is come--mr . bingley is come.--he is , indeed .	3.197699237801014
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	3.575185326821529
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	3.192750493068767
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs . hurst were going out .	3.4454733478345143
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	3.9816572513317654
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .	4.2833545604554475
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	3.589296440784067
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .	3.843023975203898
nothing could be more delightful !	7.9215042812775485
she is grown so brown and coarse !	3.517575652971884
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	2.7233573864372835
they are my old friends .	5.174612814278954
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	3.87244769807297
the possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	3.8552172369847
darcy!--my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .	3.047168129811842
mr . collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	2.61059729512696
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle .	3.4045848410574298
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	4.517769570559202
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh !	3.32313999902047
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p . i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .	2.725420678426319
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	2.5431566525314127
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	2.7255491180773284
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	2.7107044216117027
" when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "	2.841521348517458
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite . "	3.3586027679719255
he had to be sure done much .	6.110232591261609
" your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	2.5510557038271573
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs . collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	2.700820993938411
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	2.826747306292316
mr . gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street .	2.5436976985194213
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .	2.498029896053651
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . "	3.4279371902586737
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .	2.8894987387081654
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .	2.255063994427065
" mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library . "	2.1875579687662507
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	3.4897371498607277
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved .	3.6156715331651648
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	3.3315112787851136
on finding mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "	2.903052833578097
does he know his real character ? "	4.193605921385706
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	3.166442622919658
" let her be called down .	4.392354136654977
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	2.687969031747522
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	2.3051461446378347
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	2.4190575023658605
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	2.6393374778690846
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "	2.29652012640305
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .	3.431711675229001
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "	3.3658360250423223
" her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .	2.2857725943015486
chapter xvii .	12.028774447866011
she is not such a simpleton .	6.14060976120879
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr . darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	2.9918133694165805
you must contrive to send somebody .	4.390413037150845
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	3.4961895008569512
at present we have nothing to guide us .	3.9709035290195054
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	2.2697734474063695
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "	2.788321800543729
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	3.2788155291966543
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . "	3.969555653149861
lord bless me !	10.023271654701595
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	2.1385289904140254
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing?--mr .	2.8326990194801374
mr . bingley arrived .	8.459348179021056
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry .	2.7499166755881035
" i have , sir . "	4.913246216842053
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	2.7784554727942132
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	4.1007510974505195
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	2.62790678925879
mr . bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	2.1406923062670513
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .	2.4153377466687345
to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	2.6117535266766594
a young man , such as you describe mr . bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . "	2.760952288693172
we must not all expect jane's good fortune . "	3.20147494723397
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was elizabeth's intimate friend .	2.7231452584485565
their reception at home was most kind .	4.232896665678649
said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	3.7891503877360635
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	2.5726050451291003
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	2.6717559037868592
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	3.015699850968882
" really , mr . collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly .	3.6845263817958864
mr . darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	3.312276884035624

his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	2.8067612965027577
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr . bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	2.407593083700903

i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	2.220291640306046
" it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "	2.6943286237897928
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	2.490160468916659

her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity .	2.417725397576477

" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .	3.057794351778041
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william's too long .	3.995201267315321
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	2.270647159242174
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? "	2.4082895523261936

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	2.430365674132735

at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "	2.963961123073958
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	3.163797569677633

mrs . bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	2.3510002672646633
in understanding darcy was the superior .	4.776590105084238

all were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	2.0689530280022677
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .	3.4384973846507783
mrs . bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well.--against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	2.3592370763325596
" another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you . "	3.96876362907206

and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	2.5290181176849846
the first part of mrs . gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	2.6019934577078447
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	2.04165070399985
" he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	3.193099203801828
but make a virtue of it by all means .	3.682485609492853
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	2.927106732060023
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .	2.5733680461975643
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr . darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? "	2.624938842162017
and gravely glancing at mr . darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i shall keep mine to swell my song . "	2.1633483121906463
her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	3.257017994921443
" i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .	2.885404574490406
elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	3.278506891480268
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	3.707133838299277
it cannot last long .	6.701572956894923
and then when we came away it was such fun !	3.783107566078404
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	2.243153183440594
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? "	3.1435735987852085
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	2.3912102950012923
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	2.6522320791637646
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to-day ?	2.8925765701635147
" yes , in conjunction with his friend . "	2.9098677786138905
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	2.694233659082999
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	3.0703337930376144
" this is a wretched beginning indeed !	3.942201652447424
cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be?--how could his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress ? "	2.4763435387963786
" you did !	10.114226737742074
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "	3.187941973652
all field sports were over .	5.216486689264271
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . "	3.348581571165834
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	4.063970029480192
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	1.7248455765855064
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	2.3140447344624704
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "	2.190851160120979
mr . collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	2.502767821243847
" i am , " said he , with a firm voice .	4.577153932002833
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	2.648513801977455
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	2.4519207594941954
you may depend upon my seeking no further . "	3.2231650775447496
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	3.560812020281348
at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . hurst and elizabeth herself .	3.1129894723320133
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living .	3.5337331412975606
" the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it ? "	2.5844283134892594
" lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . "	3.211457034727953
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? "	3.3798075032253867
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	4.008853276469054
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	3.062586206681962
her reflections were in general satisfactory .	5.297223955812231
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately .	3.953801103264429
" i desire you will do no such thing .	3.35333698615497
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	2.294479207457235
" an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .	3.418351571799279
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	2.3376711325997066
and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "	2.8932604685507677
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	3.1571359873229143
" i have already told her so once , by your desire . "	2.996992442635534
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr . bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	3.1316254257052614
" you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "	2.718422938139593
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "	2.573108756226798
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain ?	2.927939619080703
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "	2.9099920210148618
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	3.020413010355606
i was uncomfortable enough .	6.616691777034256
the tête-à-tête surprised them .	6.633993728254639
1.f.3 .	77.2072484543645
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "	3.0130786486423404
" oh , yes .	6.638016816030631
" i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	3.1980527871811986
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded .	3.057617280578063
chapter iv .	12.028774447866011
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	2.6977979792346307
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	1.9788760363069016
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	3.1752013696649315
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .	3.4004854154324056
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	2.4477153600543686
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	2.6038483283068317
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	2.8550698782943313
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . "	2.4812897899507886
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	3.3934311053987756
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	2.59043848275802
mr . bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .	2.854850291720663
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me .	2.4523179183814077
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	2.3346809321968287
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "	3.1553613862750027
you shall hear what she says . "	4.155857593545181
" oh !	5.461298269298178
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard . "	2.875952305049326
mr . hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	3.085953922045522
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	3.5783190827065914
she had obtained private intelligence that mr . darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	2.8291458005332517
" i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy ; " grieved--shocked .	3.7921046660053723
sir william did not say much .	5.461578765279852
mr . collins on his return highly gratified mrs . bennet by admiring mrs . philips's manners and politeness .	2.9171084509129823
i am very , very sorry .	5.160986720317833
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	2.0685537023914518
" if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think . "	3.180544938860999
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "	3.36222398965809
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	2.442396828436755
" no"--said darcy , " i have made no such pretension .	5.112883710418797
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs . bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "	2.0784929672525103
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "	2.9787880513621596
" probably not;--but mr . darcy can please where he chuses .	3.963399254086912
1.f .	75.27981737932598
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .	3.6405530492342884
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	3.5299564738268954
i did not wink at you . "	4.076630907400587
what will you think of my vanity ?	5.354712736653072
mr . collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	2.3892188550265985
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	2.451731561272766
i told my sister philips so the other day .	3.9536486013382803
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	2.038528053475141
" do not you want to know who has taken it ? "	3.11026865141999
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs . forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	2.73874614439676
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "	3.529200884543832
the hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	2.3932021977643436
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	2.537860437652455
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	3.6634465432717325
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	3.324860456884191
mrs . bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	2.8938959838211735
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	2.6532216225296823
they will have nothing else to do . "	4.07933362086327
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	2.711931772549152
there can be no love in all this .	4.101270768454664
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	4.027611782629278
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	3.3456306200901027
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	3.0857452962423766
her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	2.246960361856842
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .	3.5427578010942424
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	3.058767210927474
i expected you to stay two months .	4.2857450683601845
" that is very strange .	5.7881789715596135
a great deal more passed at the other table .	4.860890145696963
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	2.1614938440930946
" _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it . "	3.9901230330724555
darcy.--_i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "	2.7122376363720644
" i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom !	4.144129118157803
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	2.378121419039358
pemberley was now georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .	3.080568597383517
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "	3.35841962470893
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	2.5567276955453684
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .	3.631120837961409
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky . "	3.399543048345256
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	2.425797618250932
thought elizabeth .	22.039868384043046
" their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .	2.886348527050752
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life .	2.412152114555809
when mr . collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .	2.424941052817743
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c . are sufficiently known .	2.228771954079854
i understand that mr . collins has made you an offer of marriage .	4.371245040614587
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	3.001475654359841
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	4.358354646331166
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	2.1559027257155106
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	4.095817146651349
i wish you had been there .	4.906034509914947
the loss of her daughter made mrs . bennet very dull for several days .	3.9015308079554174
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .	4.799532616677447
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs . philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	2.9977190374056812
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	3.4439216129254073
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "	2.5621476991074394
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ .	3.009477548896682
darcy . "	12.21544495548457
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . "	2.8276740602421464
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	2.679687503253206
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling .	2.2795163172027118
my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "	3.6722791923307163
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	4.8304717063476215
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	2.513675786137692
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "	2.819045181091625
mr . gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	3.135074604839446
why does she not come in ? "	4.203166501584983
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "	3.820706323166273
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	3.108364445093389
why should they try to influence him ?	4.003743750834885
" it is evident by this , " added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . "	3.3478141356290148
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	3.7411601598095197
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	5.058802582463573
" i am far from attributing any part of mr . bingley's conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	2.626998490195629
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family . "	2.5869222560190535
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage . "	4.464839515833653
lady catherine seemed pleased .	7.188156191672866
" both , " replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "	2.186058464006987
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer .	4.023741127303511
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	3.7816944165131265
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .	2.8048632255894965
_invented by m^{rs } bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._ _engraved for no .	2.249780000003978
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn .	2.5046640252400674
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine . "	2.2870387880677447
chapter xvii .	12.028774447866011
pray write instantly , and let me understand it--unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "	2.380479969410597
where , where is my uncle ? "	4.157393805054167
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	3.863211543395394
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "	2.428222063822686
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . bennet's civilities .	2.1298070986428863
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .	3.6264353155432207
" yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	3.4503882470429685
mrs . gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	2.4876638129603967
" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "	2.873565812371361
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases . "	4.339815174993715
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	2.6928729902641417
" excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant . "	3.1571568548913334
" your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "	2.9328646966430356
mrs . reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	2.858729542255513
if you love mr . darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .	3.920507502733837
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	2.2708353478942276
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the rules is very easy .	2.536489554153001
his surprise was great .	7.274818061445821
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	2.97564176922296
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	3.034594754334856
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	2.4620601282614003
is this to be endured !	6.4639017541615615
" and what arts did he use to separate them ? "	2.7781339026163487
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	2.131525277335955
such a countenance , such manners !	4.911451440638042
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "	2.647377457554672
" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "	2.6854612405538987
cried mrs . gardiner .	9.51264371485777
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	2.0937298227189016
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .	2.6088442180785223
what will wickham say ?	6.901913105392596
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .	2.348235048832875
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	3.0267395973111437
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr . darcy appeared .	2.682060085816892
" and they are really to be married ! "	4.204938829634742
mr . denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	2.8170926070251836
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .	3.0543548189836476
oh !	22.329577332847695
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	2.6677844672705224
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr . and mrs . gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	3.1741765292037556
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr . darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	3.0575030024138017
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq .	3.198781243784511
" i do not believe mrs . long will do any such thing .	3.114028103753882
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	5.3160892360763965
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	2.432417154878948
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair .	2.646508964770002
said she .	15.157501563791481
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ?	2.4259887630676795
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	3.6362667260726567
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	3.2021775147656757
" your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	3.9265445934760232
i was ready to die of laughter .	4.316884229031546
" oh , jane , take care . "	4.0509544937394635
we can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	2.2686473873369133
" miss bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be .	3.5286967704061967
his character was to speak for itself .	4.447354036570124
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	2.1910369429605163
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .	3.459137340662209
it is what every body says .	5.338969380717447
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	3.0956507287323856
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	2.8048799532341824
" i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want . "	2.907271161104205
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	2.7484237897741775
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	2.5915811528515085
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	2.4674673067013018
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .	3.0319522021060843
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .	2.688321021380098
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	2.126232135226534
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . darcy .	2.568135329413619
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .	4.272838115042507
" indeed i do not dare . "	5.528136510164439
i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	2.2455349356000807
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .	2.823665831270099
supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	2.6008416077951515
he is perfectly amiable .	8.034622930509865
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , william collins . "	2.267935644347855
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	3.102502592226789
" yes , ma'am , all . "	3.657670372102608
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	2.409111381510559
mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	3.6952784495332143
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	2.9434867030146146
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	2.1985450288023505
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .	3.6709252052693397
" this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .	3.3221970006710633
mrs . reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	2.2524697912662135
the officer was the very mr . denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	2.486895576362779
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .	2.3501921986652157
mrs . philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr . jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr . collins by jane's introduction of him .	2.540554325029979
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	1.8336751023757818
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .	2.5510080455059962
" aye , there she comes , " continued mrs . bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way.--but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	2.3397633362864827
" shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? "	2.816441519915148
" why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "	2.841372129418355
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare . "	2.591071174820403
but they did pass away , and mr . and mrs . gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .	2.9110163504728366
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . "	4.033877595818279
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	3.970844486994304
how he lived i know not .	5.874140860986453
" and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? "	2.839835038965632
oh !	22.329577332847695
" yes , madam , " said mrs . bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine .	3.5825367814416973
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	2.4290418141919936
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	2.8644532305331425
he was silent .	9.98343829035907
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	3.1569231499262322
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	2.5760235940848566
sir , i do indeed .	9.897848359683755
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .	2.35134055722935
" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend.--"you dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "	2.7266846838916545
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	4.38184402259843
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	2.782416041957494
" and may i ask ? "	4.414785400034711
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies .	2.6792523138969746
* * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . bennet's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	2.6657416823673987
" oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all .	3.805577251185728
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	3.7480966757232257
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?	3.6243803975952282
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	3.383506117197642
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr . collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .	2.3514097565259777
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	2.6080159326376027
have you never happened to see her there ? "	4.272066980280322
" i am all astonishment .	5.244426892549859
he was angry .	11.032215781594173
a little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better . "	2.747541728566707
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	2.4056064351061024
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she .	4.401531228596641
" undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	2.332227879520175
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	2.446264600765573
" that is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "	2.698564351004795
" you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged .	2.6417545507373967
but slyness seems the fashion .	4.916854984937791
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	2.394780491434075
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .	2.9206297220253723
despite these efforts , project gutenberg-tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be stored , may contain " defects , " such as , but not limited to , incomplete , inaccurate or corrupt data , transcription errors , a copyright or other intellectual property infringement , a defective or damaged disk or other medium , a computer virus , or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment .	1.8401195080518316
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	3.123815698815208
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs . bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	2.7557754878882093
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest .	2.2637227205271855
mr . darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	3.4452170234635187
and it was not wholly without foundation .	7.128333900497246
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	2.5670014313676575
this cannot be!--engaged to mr . darcy !	5.92465035943071
" well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	3.34423755337212
" but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "	2.6751803870975936
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	2.6653449157040536
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . "	2.342238063611116
to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	2.7949994637458815
to mr . and mrs . gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	3.04565495187251
" my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	2.9709267393999017
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her.'	3.5492279671339526
" design !	18.803778081603788
1.b .	75.27981737932598
" already arisen ! "	6.350378308953763
said her aunt .	13.832088625391208
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "	2.742814564739928
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	2.5387996957504226
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "	2.396382712483043
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .	3.6748521846202595
--cried elizabeth .	19.551594180129673
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding .	3.529607362733246
" as often as i can .	5.3836906152159525
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "	2.244498199245141
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	2.9472894693028366
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	2.6306439374738355
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	2.062019051242711

" my dear mr . bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome !	3.8863583958632715
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	2.7255918053439863
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	2.867966716891054
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease . "	2.9665681372936423
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please . "	2.994445457281164

when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	3.2568505694193934
" my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "	3.214066123373689
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . bennet and the children .	3.587648866199803
chapter iv .	12.028774447866011
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	2.491023404735521
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . collins .	3.407685050812084
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	3.3719053993855983
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	3.3202945291297823
" and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters . "	3.3896001747421867

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	2.316784039873736
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ?	3.036758964428642
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .	5.031836332552242
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	3.264755189165245
no.--i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "	3.236922048558249
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	2.7721905756120133
" true .	14.222035592559086
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	4.47320989707654
" his manners are very different from his cousin's . "	3.5925922230643095
" but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . long has promised to introduce him . "	3.138315047350168
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me.--these causes must be stated , though briefly.--the situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you .	1.8682998298746367
it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened .	2.779855409104316
he owns it himself without disguise . "	3.605115778924889
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte's marriage .	2.6810308407382344
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	3.26601202058818
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .	3.401502742965997
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "	2.6045340400996277
this room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	2.6415293695077007
elizabeth made no answer .	5.0122485175164435
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	4.03978392991037
" if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins--but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards . "	2.8299141252955526
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me.--it is done , however , and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	2.310814015947109
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	2.487140758596479
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	2.8327753538778455
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	2.36592762240706
" but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	3.2902162778276893
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	2.492987912134088
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	3.3373952867222623
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	2.5673672977404545
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	2.468347308778973
darcy made no answer .	6.054265085649783
this was not very consoling to mrs . bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	3.763607782358608
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	2.75379754107512
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach .	2.53769551609367
he cannot afford it .	6.793521951875126
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	2.811812819675747
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	2.3774303912107286
it was then disclosed in the following manner .	4.058213072516381
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "	2.3334880573747565
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "	2.163406167219894
she could think of nothing but of mr . wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr . collins were once silent .	2.8347029531537844
" an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _us_ .	3.6836061583699897
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	3.6882493684113467
" certainly .	17.588497718823405
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	3.7307793651145373
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	2.893447373938395
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .	2.6450429007646292
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	4.117317441679875
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters .	2.515786071829211
what are men to rocks and mountains ?	3.596436591974411
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you .	2.849277347457682
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	2.796631184433034
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .	2.830306382313237
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "	3.1991329318297104
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? "	2.8436789278797363
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	2.6945175492639892
oh !	22.329577332847695
must it be so ? "	6.432192919944451
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .	2.85458650067437
mrs . bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	2.285961239820623
chapter ix .	12.028774447866011
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr .	2.1792081982737077
his daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative .	2.4985408860792813
their sister's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	3.048107006073467
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "	3.196959443740095
" i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	2.883152079536329
as they drove to mr . gardiner's door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	2.6070006488494064
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs .	3.028052499400581
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . "	2.614321448784556
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	2.564909698848322
i saw them the night before last . "	3.581244791608745
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	2.617374058865855
what a fine thing for our girls ! "	3.5427204720495613
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr .	2.7400499160677745
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	2.9212174897550467
do not distress me by the idea .	4.51200551334878
" why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned .	3.0271165101253503
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	2.380159701929306
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s . unless a copyright notice is included .	2.0004697906063127
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	3.683693217114616
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged .	2.6543959218819575
" i have no right to give _my_ opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	3.469488776653984
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	2.72519962472133
mrs . hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	3.2195185921250538
" i do not see what right mr . darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . "	2.532113402940949
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . darcy's explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .	2.6733568385269977
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away .	2.4057239177808984
1.d .	75.27981737932598
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	2.6860927591224346
such a charming man!--so handsome !	5.975839321989858
" is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )	2.4164814610844214
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .	3.0539243997997865
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	2.1313116052738486
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "	3.4063472868913682
mr . bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	2.2774087382969563
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	2.4363179314078023
" what is his name ? "	4.765778555491729
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	2.0751500897286843
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs . bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	2.6180076150218863
in lydia's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	2.5662352205385366
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . "	2.3621224744845515
he has more to give .	5.923925776280911
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	2.6490131057908934
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	2.8936448314835523
kitty , run down and order the carriage .	3.758250589767636
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . collins's side , and as many bows on sir william's , they departed .	2.7103714953393494
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely .	2.6832422948033297
cried elizabeth .	14.233632662163346
another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	3.057867549803563
by you , i was properly humbled .	6.314643708966591
you alluded to something else .	5.004834900331975
your's , very sincerely , " m .	3.947536649153425
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr . s . fairbanks , ak , 99712 . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	1.7742866357516145
" it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease .	2.500548356858041
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	2.8306483711123622
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . hurst had a house .	2.1790561318674695
elizabeth silently attended her .	7.026681629993246
and with a bow to mr . darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many stared.--many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	2.4730254871655615
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	1.9057675009868271
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can.--but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without . "	2.547968572338126
" that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	3.9603740195076913
you take delight in vexing me .	4.364353315671814
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	2.47276135229747
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .	2.691019906174485
" i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "	2.553645163375319
you mentioned _two_ instances .	6.484500116374186
" and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "	2.9094090653474765
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	2.053020059693452
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	2.053130510901198
mr . hurst and mr . bingley were at piquet , and mrs . hurst was observing their game .	3.759093174335234
_i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "	2.662594609648729
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	2.7897414757190426
elizabeth was now to see mr . wickham for the last time .	4.662593992494057
" perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth .	3.5691626418783504
but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	3.9220066951418677
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	4.140683066282523
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _being created_ . "	3.793245475648732
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	2.4732149842354616
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? "	3.141665451923513
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	2.3534387008807647
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	2.5555522050973587
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place--which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .	2.530697691213085
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "	2.845157907438491
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	2.3410994881150753
bromley , of course.--if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . "	2.895592075805726
mrs . hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	2.587667306687053
" miss bennet , do you know who i am ?	4.8838737797661045
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	2.8352025406568537
he danced only four dances !	4.968038147476892
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	2.518238653364602
" and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !	2.885841883668716
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	2.349189324691021
mrs . bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	2.453844211412908
" if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	2.503792556397858
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .	2.708628755267693
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	2.9108946848808377
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .	2.292893727702185
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr . darcy's regard . "	3.153396046605747
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	2.984031591169943
i will go directly to mr . bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . "	3.7754820049479947
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	2.1757388118665193
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	2.176620318340225
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	2.600083326937821
" but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	2.5959376506093648
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	3.3259866723789124
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	3.572478058381233
" you quite mistook mr . darcy .	4.973114856870264
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . "	2.0608479131426276
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . darcy's progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	2.4184323357150426
it was to be such a secret ! "	5.049177739841558
" i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .	3.249629457238251
i cannot think of it without abhorrence . "	4.449623291889151
" you are over scrupulous surely .	4.164809887674579
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	3.4899009538907726
" you cannot be too much on your guard .	4.12132788226054
if i could but see _you_ as happy !	4.279284057811003
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .	4.311326236859614
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	2.1916510995319496
since her father's death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "	2.7289172164322033
a house in town !	8.796554841069987
mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	2.186430179657614
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	3.6021267670378374
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	2.824758570491514
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	2.4930172019743226
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together .	2.9029450550361875
did you see him while you were at lambton ?	3.5298067109279563
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	2.230194037158672
said he ; " that is rather singular . "	4.409357991136334
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "	3.31823985614139
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .	3.106007565535513
she smiled , but made no answer .	4.214860744557495
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	2.577934171737566
she would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house . "	4.021670466242292
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	2.5076113335225054
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	2.5465821508743405
when first mr . bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .	3.416651897697122
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	3.8867734348864076
mr . collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	2.125145556951759
but mrs . bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	5.526330495640674
" haye-park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !	2.4568880626431917
i should infinitely prefer a book . "	3.6033564523827932
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .	3.70008247255498
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	3.948451757635506
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master ; she comes here to-morrow with him . "	2.0516288620123566
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	2.909225984120334
" and men take care that they should . "	3.6191053576169137
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	2.4883873375742507
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	2.3561358534525034
" pray tell your sister that i long to see her . "	3.051902313065164
it was unpardonable .	9.634027322372354
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	2.3727874004749308
she shook her head .	6.990561859182487
shocking ! "	18.704009402083823
the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	2.2705167779450823
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	2.0455831891138994
but enough of this .	7.536394171189723
" i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . "	2.6709204435222387
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	2.10242461593634
" and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently .	4.170678727628779
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	2.5175846171776897
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?	4.726623256687264
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	3.6023452310419795
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .	2.85872673000429
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all mr . collins's scruples of leaving mr . and mrs . bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that mr . wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	2.5288006306082527
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	2.3680858974618397
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	2.739767260208629
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	3.1084835567057545
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .	4.398424240680613
i do not deserve it .	6.177561215411302
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear . "	2.6097935597066977
" very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .	4.039821144102582
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .	2.490396725041274
" but you--how are you ? "	4.065325900810908
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	2.2489109686339908
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	2.2177433051099684
i will read it to you-- " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	2.2462359278589132
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	2.5243159819902012
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	2.426946688416577
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "	2.506160059332773
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	3.399801910015169
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "	3.847953345676858
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .	4.227797908299561
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "	2.3893021268620775
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "	3.5786840838412357
a clear ten thousand per annum .	4.221710799886691
1.e.9 .	72.84391013485809
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	2.8396452219357258
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm .	2.307997070277733
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	3.099178789062463
but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	2.4466710341974256
it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	2.948966946928079
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	3.748525591268266
she replied in the affirmative .	6.087542353708129
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .	3.347714330824364
when mr . bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	4.146363524104223
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	2.341210766688021
he is so excessively handsome !	5.473546202231687
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	2.8184087250990446
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	2.7674691110788596
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	4.615060145455282
" yes--the late mr . darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	2.9148317434966224
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	2.6814340137146537
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	4.532947202324692
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	2.3902554792783612
but who was your mother ?	5.671636004628124
" you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "	2.8163736139452418
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr . wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	2.752203196882805
chapter i .	14.194926143872399
it is too long ago .	5.615404904267366
she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	2.5350512536112086
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "	2.321218918254447
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "	2.532847657717336
i only hope they may have half my good luck .	3.30371203624773
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	2.1791123272031343
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . and mrs . gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	3.430046031144032
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "	2.7889907282749986
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	2.5125277266599824
" and so was i . "	4.331573690054276
but that is one great difference between us .	3.8220319246358234
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	2.5556598629344274
london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	2.4426830761560088
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ?	2.0446632703802705
" i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs . bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .	3.7360730421617316
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written . "	4.330635382012544
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	2.0996272943871905
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	3.1236673936657846
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	3.488738424918028
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	3.010040283197636
" how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr . darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved . "	2.493412877958235
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	2.839048430920347
i do not believe she often sees such at home . "	2.9771392644863792
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	2.6523486700166905
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "	2.810212493561349
" what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr . darcy had much better finish his letter . "	3.2932859080263155
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! "	4.269672681796056
his character was decided .	7.350888946396534
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr . darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one , whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is impossible .	2.5735679771119786
she certainly did not hate him .	4.404591081997021
" oh , yes!--he was to come there with wickham , you know .	3.5192517708109756
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	3.2050688174371627
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "	3.2096625901655105
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	2.588587861013248
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	3.993153880424646
i hardly know how mr . collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "	3.12712655378363
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	3.4030578580406154
" can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "	2.4605603558974787
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	2.565676765984464
all loveliness and goodness as she is !	4.32700114364227
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr . bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	2.5165987061516013
end of vol .	10.474441945478755
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	2.7765962946900182
wickham only shook his head .	6.0959636744969075
i promised them so faithfully !	5.107354945897322
chapter xix .	12.028774447866011
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	2.466190891944661
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	3.255929747650008
they found mr . bennet still up .	6.70346271518915
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .	3.161797630565564
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	2.783572075912766
mr . darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet . "	3.1866019092102356
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . "	3.2008982708123703
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require . "	3.0354095743876783
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .	2.5802617246477033
" money !	18.821097813989304
" aye--that is because you have the right disposition .	3.575219584079878
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	2.682246473516516
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long . "	2.8946925229402662
" how abominable!--i wonder that the very pride of this mr . darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it . "	2.3488249108661288
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .	3.590090845205571
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	2.289979063633414
but you have chosen your fault well.--i really cannot _laugh_ at it .	2.695844811074537
said jane .	21.15540475916685
mrs . gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	2.19183538119067
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find .	3.547746703402701
" heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me such an evil . "	1.9744330725807404
they followed her into the dining-parlour .	5.442580074959719
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	2.57855290961116
your idea of the ponies is delightful .	5.089022329655584
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .	3.855347181403157
mr . darcy danced only once with mrs . hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	2.80502588178711
when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .	2.918173808613687
it would have suited me in every respect . "	3.875387149349779
cried mrs . bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls .	2.7714237204872654
i must beg to return to the house . "	3.7693156514516017
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	2.86023084052525
" when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .	3.7309542791871757
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "	2.7239923651831903
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . "	2.5651811052145446
" mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them .	5.003531561483237
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	2.616708449443149
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	3.7225887419711405
my dear , " cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	4.602124178371038
" yes;--but he seemed to like his second better . "	3.2285023870325413
" we never had any governess . "	3.9122862920549553
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	2.3217879310990464
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . "	2.6620092090095087
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger---- " " if he had had any compassion for _me_ , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much !	3.2123608653757785
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	2.4916128419276946
" this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced . "	2.712680494122686
and what do you think she said besides ?	4.698627043351148
" your examination of mr . darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley;--"and pray what is the result ? "	3.3782541842068223
" why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	3.0566311895517995
human nature is so prone to fall into it !	3.4665648737000905
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	2.484200117658023
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure .	3.197094187253361
she was wild to be at home--to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	2.2565430898054157
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled .	2.5317516555021657
" yes , she called yesterday with her father .	3.4566521866995243
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james's .	2.237877881660538
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3 .	2.117186925555424
to put me on my guard ?	4.871347688985045
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	2.553282323233235
consider how important every moment is , in such a case . "	3.744357512344649
cried elizabeth .	14.233632662163346
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	4.79104065132522
i wish i could see her .	6.002258851728941
" i cannot believe it .	5.92492849179409
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	2.6232648005091175
" we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	1.9997468929943656
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	2.738635326884255
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	3.610743316215296
1813 .	41.088003610396605
" my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour .	2.969009411817699
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . "	2.5130525766525524
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better .	2.501621099164772
you had much better dance . "	4.904943993448239
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	2.3602231213206584
" you look pale .	7.2205169137940866
as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	2.5696114630683775
they must have seen them together for ever . "	3.8526382992210513
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr . bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	4.149866549108074
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	2.937614954284695
" you may well warn me against such an evil .	2.9859363136439905
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	3.7897030332452846
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .	2.5303431838319517
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself .	2.8525172407852226
i hope she will turn out well . "	3.390055830142909
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . collins first came to hunsford . "	3.6768833951685926
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner:-- " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	2.55686305884366
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "	2.5097696580494264
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	2.7332839861779346
i knew you would be wishing me joy . "	3.4332081881035865
five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing .	3.200604413088057
i am perfectly satisfied .	7.596194828791493
" but how did he account for it ? "	3.6396069033534757
" but depend upon it , mr . collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason .	3.375570901321247
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	2.2907248453308604
mr . collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	2.670737998146289
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	2.6056805646582366
chapter xii .	13.866366423968332
1.e.4 .	75.27981737932598
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	2.7708343782676255
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	2.5390058406712077

vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	2.799061534302743
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	2.7415509308063317
but do not be cast down .	5.104945183630054
" i am sure there is not on _his_ .	4.451925312707111
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham .	2.3757898308439813
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	2.8600152812182547
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	2.280322377503533
to mr . bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	2.412941159883016
" where is your sister ? "	5.410308750931904
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	2.9012666799691558
thank god !	19.64506353837938
she cried : " this is delightful indeed!--she will be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my good , kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage every thing .	2.031791646290381
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr .	2.6878885158900716
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	2.8268107855001854
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	2.392637394954899
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest .	3.9604030171587272
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	2.811849688199391
they were natural and just .	5.582009058968967
she comes to us to-day .	5.64898705242023
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it . "	2.974693970510343
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	2.086531009186006
i am prodigiously proud of him .	4.366358619319961
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .	3.9793008683705127
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	3.06915901744372
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	3.0245959852991784
said mrs . bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	3.43425544668115
" i must not decide on my own performance . "	3.2160285099980532
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	2.926339435726939
what are we to do ! "	4.350691842377278
but your _family_ owe me nothing .	4.152901226233397
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	3.479552756211667
but she is nothing to me now .	4.75796497740083
how mr . darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	6.811978939057285
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	3.043013950568837
" what do you think ?	6.059964399495337
" how nicely we are crammed in ! "	3.1388887179149685
how is such a man to be worked on ?	5.375822875271708
yes , " said elizabeth drily--"mr . darcy is uncommonly kind to mr . bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "	3.1905947164098323
it is a pity they are not handsome !	4.946033163985161
on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .	2.3630033315340953
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention .	3.2282741288615693
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	2.684033568014511
" oh !	5.461298269298178
i am going away myself . "	4.453419509455544
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . darcy's looks and behaviour .	3.1641752134617436
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	1.8610347296344212
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .	2.462244100981426
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	2.3830256885932415
" what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ? "	3.420596755455032
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	2.5434442216958013
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "	3.4566274307777074
in spite of having been at st . james's , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	2.3336151560387997
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	2.794869783542424
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted---- " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .	2.510541193993849
" she is a very good kind of girl , i believe .	4.303749585783381
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .	2.6546048847051704
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )	3.015593936866879
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	2.6281606568770703
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	3.3129987299282164
" not as you represent it .	4.249558337124716
but vanity , not love , has been my folly.--pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	2.364821666541163
" no ; but it must be done soon . "	4.607272558397806
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	2.2315807377855577
there was also a postscript to this effect .	3.7395092621274957
" and mary king is safe ! "	3.793130511420681
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "	4.866273343954107
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .	2.322130606252369
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	3.1350246577366034
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .	2.872961462805536
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .	2.9791543844539086
as for your elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "	2.5051354329983755
" sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs . bennet , alarmed .	3.8486350199072406
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs . long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr . morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "	2.595218520989943
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	2.495589643242208
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain .	3.0044057509352307
her father lifted up his eyes .	4.447747481933247
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .	3.4898038259030946
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	2.5728056848260445
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	3.5337585910157108
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . "	2.265604449915532
you blamed me for coming ? "	4.229538253336532
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	2.6310317510404415
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .	2.9271107543461192
" in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "	3.0589805275108684
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	2.730904114758684
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	3.2017367597714372
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone .	2.199112635352345
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	4.06053253021985
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .	3.194022153602769
bingley met them with hopes that mrs . bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .	3.090169201707769
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "	2.5455902036629094
he seldom appeared really animated .	4.983510967796567
" he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	4.4975077952309706
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought mr . wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	2.3148171754834195
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	2.6515181548977296
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .	3.866719307791967
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	2.7494254497459556
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "	3.3016521140941006
adieu to disappointment and spleen .	5.146817206144719
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	2.8984743176248906
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope .	4.039247843704685
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	4.298386732269128
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .	3.089743433300805
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .	7.154300803865632
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	4.106370540738681
" yet why did he come ? "	4.01060713310995
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "	2.601413339797923
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	2.0795573557820624
mrs . gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	2.952226924459554
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	3.9148833960391993
how can they suit each other?--do you know mr .	3.0744667187032895
" what can be the meaning of this ! "	3.2296278972322865
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	3.0430503958584243
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	2.527389187006887
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	2.4022360606336766
elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	1.974378386552285
" all young ladies accomplished !	5.262476255463028
" i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .	3.182376876846167
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's . "	2.539751187676739
she went on .	12.965342588741407
" yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	3.036254970559077
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	3.0939020480759534
" mr . darcy is not to be laughed at ! "	4.575536019684808
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . bennet's ill humour or ill health .	3.1861749950660254
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .	3.094160647812622
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	2.8889945768455494
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said .	2.951678594780655
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	2.7603043956650435
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr . darcy , and mr . darcy only , entered the room .	2.7323030584327896
they had frequently been staying with her in town .	3.8283770012359484
i told mrs . collins so before you came .	4.834499704629392
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	2.444721365134785
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	3.5866116803994714
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .	2.749367033255338
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	2.6100884105908224
" what would she have said?--how would she have behaved ? "	2.9207856016358154
chapter x . elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	2.687563342444258
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	2.5453525503195333
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	2.1676462803821455
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	2.401418795148692
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	2.1064504430432867
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room .	2.826988127845806
" you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr .	2.493451894300002
it adds even another motive .	4.932725540594621
mr . darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	2.9319319763280904
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "	2.764341373415366
the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	2.6204675780489723
why jane--you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !	2.9310545202096754
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "	2.702122901390618
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm collection .	2.014888469742831
at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	2.881777328718588
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	2.2215587741128346
" and do you really know all this ? "	3.2596776879518696
mrs . gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . darcy by character perfectly well .	3.1115543985476193
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	3.8752351887633636
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	2.5093861234700627
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design .	2.520394571997149
the discussion of mr . collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	2.888845664705648
nor was darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	2.897638598083853
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	4.195103849498037
mr . darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	2.6742553510185534
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	3.3724027126943414
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease .	2.7476471250829917
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	7.960305104534658
let me hear what it is . "	4.181914395595624
" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "	3.496412909870549
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them .	2.3649043286841547
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	3.5167133223340277
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	2.327417581752446
but these things happen so often !	4.4623507991353915
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "	2.9008059915357496
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr . bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw .	3.6826736585164737
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	2.709428875272323
chapter vi .	12.028774447866011
is she handsome ? "	6.6167542254662575
mrs . long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .	3.2546964747739673
i can hardly write for laughing .	5.154198616350029
" you may as well call it impertinence at once .	3.3548169271991073
mr . bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it.--mr .	2.3068799747984032
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	3.0711860003058717
" i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	3.0250565493803494
the officers will find women better worth their notice .	3.189193720805009
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	3.303156271664754
" aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "	2.697926230047236
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	3.6546001097693126
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master .	3.4872234154671897
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "	2.7382230411441655
" oh !	5.461298269298178
accompanied by a violent yawn .	5.8521628358885405
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	2.248719465100229
mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	2.6262174369650912
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	4.053079283192129
" then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs . bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly . "	2.880747023579704
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	2.1839583146268984
" may i ask to what these questions tend ? "	3.1029088964900473
the express was sent off directly .	4.56498335595669
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ . "	2.7574864327210222
every body is disgusted with his pride .	4.1393395011820555
mr . hurst looked at her with astonishment .	4.960546787318574
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	3.054621287438936
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	2.997623722031699
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !	2.2011607299738913
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	3.437567019422595
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable . "	3.8137769276838007
on miss lucas's persevering , however , she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it must . "	3.5618306644981255
" then , who taught you ?	4.514375765173123
" and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "	3.3015289215490244
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	2.487666589106712
" you have .	9.921737561781127
of having another daughter married to mr . collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	3.364566987193075
his belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	2.600826546255868
" i am not one and twenty . "	3.7619037500258647
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	2.6471499112145436
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to----you shall try it some day.--do your sisters play and sing ? "	2.0658993641624543
i appeal to mr . darcy:--but let me not interrupt you , sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "	1.9838933731370318
" it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley .	3.968670854614157
" indeed ! "	7.197480626426112
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--miss darcy , the daughter of mr . darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i am excessively attentive to all those things .	2.3552948736074293
mrs . collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	2.6985648685850943
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "	2.911621523901004
" and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business . "	2.4060437680455777
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point . "	2.4626317938219233
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .	3.0699918356906246
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works 1.a .	3.353721982326942
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	2.4382855656588687
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	2.990490400540567
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	2.729545101280557
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	3.8704341957025177
" well , and what news does it bring ?	4.116606783827578
" good gracious !	9.3201772054575
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter .	5.321194471916306
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .	2.4749419752031914
" i hope , my dear , " said mr . bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "	3.270990194690146
" i am , dear sir , &c . &c . " mr . gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	2.6202942806065432
" but why all this secrecy ?	4.861535692009169
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	2.9210312558992615
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	2.5518011125527806
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	3.815148214877515
at length the parsonage was discernible .	4.1985696356036
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?	3.4375350840592684
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	2.570667130231784
mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	2.3719923550340805
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal . "	4.2529658913084285
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . darcy walk into the room .	2.926455552831021
where shall you change horses?--oh !	5.25304905584721
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	4.147173685454857
how strange must it appear to him !	4.158886254107643
darcy ! "	12.301447857731699
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	2.478928060097472
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	1.963264226459879
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library . "	2.973208828346214
" i honour your circumspection .	4.781941255892709
mr . bennet treated the matter differently .	4.468977427163528
mrs . bennet could hardly contain herself .	4.147693760332926
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	5.693094648167078
the party did not supply much conversation .	4.013381585429809
mr . darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ .	3.6596962502972947
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial .	3.993522666798459
who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	2.20940549938955
mr . bingley followed his advice .	5.067548282653935
mr . bennet's expectations were fully answered .	3.979082304502575
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	2.084322189341673
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "	3.7317068186697138
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	3.103211717098132
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character .	2.389928078922118
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	2.80655683553002
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .	3.079192241637802
" why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .	3.743945756419549
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase " project gutenberg " associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .	2.007138773095462
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	3.2242345091569633
mr . bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	2.7066505011394923
wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison.--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , i can only say that i am sorry.--the necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas's accidental information , that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	2.0990497735013034
" and pray may i ask ? "	3.989572201566936
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr . bingley , if she could .	4.014114863552692
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	4.008346449526183
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	2.3687339181541716
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "	2.9011689050723657
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ .	2.9096548284445047
but our visitor was very obstinate .	4.371596066782828
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy . "	2.5126159343404266
it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	2.1836956152564713
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	2.371733024297014
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it . "	2.349388624013619
no , never .	11.228049316378758
you deserve no such attention .	5.362737518010293
chapter xiv .	13.866366423968332
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .	4.78157134662454
she says lizzy had better have taken mr . collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it .	3.122628843411659
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .	3.9024965335261856
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? "	3.0563617136889483
mrs . gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	2.538571027801012
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr . gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .	2.981422320155591
mr . collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	2.303608245295408
" what does mr . darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? "	3.326997735948414
i must speak to hill , this moment . "	3.3168838199197324
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	5.372256037538352
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	2.9422467798302683
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .	4.066198846406812
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .	2.8315473303177328
she added , " by far too much .	5.319226277208379
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	2.9620209704386538
this information , however , startled mrs . bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	2.8476904605523816
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	3.6266435142902043
they have at least that advantage . "	4.203690049451
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	2.9844643679357477
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy .	3.5563160067095194
" none at all .	6.779017514486592
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	3.4129814814492208
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	2.784606313357667
elizabeth looked surprised .	10.08125813275725
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	2.990157166358607
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	2.3879842399919555
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .	3.1412369547200254
" there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	2.499594460012126
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	2.1784249094954418
" yes--but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "	3.2507550856177168
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	2.4388380032352606
she cried.--"i , who have prided myself on my discernment!--i , who have valued myself on my abilities !	2.724014328706694
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	2.766223672736675
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	3.58252476332955
there was no help for it however .	4.530421396901603
they insist also on my seeing mr . jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	2.1630360056338462
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	3.471155013862133
" of mr . collins and lizzy .	7.788880809172076
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! "	4.861578839493444
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !	3.4970130876172676
" i am sorry it went off .	3.935386988288947
to mr . darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .	3.6537207468659743
he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	2.9115232054124616
it is of all subjects my delight .	4.132758252699135
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	3.881529011944324
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud . "	3.3228347072593873
yet he knew to the contrary himself .	4.292191522043751
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself .	2.5038139138391737
" but so we all do .	4.79040499531411
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .	3.4720556576300305
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr . darcy .	2.610376833254748
we acted with the best intentions . "	3.87275468358553
at present i am not in love with mr . wickham ; no , i certainly am not .	4.317766122471535
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	2.908565402285651
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	2.3846425729784944
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	3.4707615013762685
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	2.677841738748666
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	3.606802868501896
his temptation is not adequate to the risk . "	3.1758377898982078
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	3.0013117513852454
mr . bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr . wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , mr . wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	2.832729725064631
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "	2.069345339332605
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	2.4510516354399683
mrs . wickham !	13.044113867054039
their visits to mrs . philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	3.6028046032255467
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	2.5438337641618975
how rich and how great you will be !	4.8264966902529025
" my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious .	3.3402619117952312
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	2.6583057164835444
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	2.792186759759844
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	2.6417522841182435
mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	3.7638529079120318
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	2.2021331939085154
bingley.--it was an animating subject , and mrs . bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	3.1026141226442734
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ? "	3.915216679084911
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "	2.1093779187881063
" yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "	2.2099875529350888
mrs . gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . bennet and mrs . philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .	2.8944182681533905
let me never see either one or the other again ! "	2.893127967496911
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	2.8317290765692658
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	2.3566967862326513
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	2.471539990508609
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun !	2.2598984091804972
mr . bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	3.7070670826390946
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "	3.03066479744919
" yes .	17.108695480672036
" you have insulted me , in every possible method .	3.9964416854649922
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .	4.304514279097341
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	2.4823633483338687
" yes , all of them , i think .	5.757404161065502
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	2.2294391614005153
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .	3.8167229680145245
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .	3.665152566799022
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "	2.3323258884313995
mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	2.408357532189528
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	2.5519735974867417
jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "	3.5798872675496223
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	4.1317984536164145
" indeed i had .	6.764313437420127
" are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "	3.1376091759568814
" my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request .	4.171570611820236
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	2.320519706209445
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised , very much surprised,--so lately as mr . collins was wishing to marry you .	2.9113660232913783
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st . james's , with very decent composure .	2.258888270650414
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .	3.7277875572464096
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . "	3.2222645174119657
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	2.843860458070472
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	3.1504265577672688
cried lydia .	14.755261494902316
it was a fortnight since mrs . bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	2.6443860674583535
" mr . darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_ . "	2.725327453418642
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	3.189226729445611
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .	2.43069068968992
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	2.7627861338857183
she could think only of her letter .	4.533570866451554
i send no compliments to your mother .	4.64876860642101
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr . wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	2.2694762970553555
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	2.2010557040798435
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	3.348909047442881
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	3.1825054943831113
" a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .	4.10740166396472
" blame you !	9.69292078603372
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	3.0015739445411147
" certainly not . "	6.181203192396975
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	3.4160868585160737
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	2.1726042146261872
then turning to mr . bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	3.622439548916985
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "	3.067231505922292
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr . bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	2.5552314522939468
i know no harm of her . "	4.044998633771459
" there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	2.49723035091522
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	7.5664785816159235
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	3.202441553744222
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been .	2.579054321356745
" oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant , does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	2.0770847648464943
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	2.7559772573933565
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	2.838888065311606
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	2.9870773302630385
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	2.7807857008996715
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "	2.776937389263624
" upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	2.9615199703779784
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	2.781265447728447
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .	2.856305029766337
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . darcy returned within the stated time .	2.4399322419066287
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs . long .	4.440846383232391
" well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	3.561973128865962
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "	1.9466290549275391
the girls stared at their father .	4.876503840729163
mr . collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	2.088988510108777
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr . denny comes back from town . "	3.3845725669253617
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	3.188061575370961
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters .	2.22549879037547
she was teazed by mr . collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	2.9552283694568096
" you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan . "	2.8599654417793463
mrs . bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	2.5922351135069523
that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner .	2.7230100858605226
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	2.627243451872282
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	3.389373959084018
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	2.8716606935565685
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	2.813610989625221
i congratulate her .	10.20266149213771
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .	4.217763074058757
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	2.8919420595774725
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	2.3503495805588956
chapter xiv .	13.866366423968332
he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	2.558577864347003
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	2.6167210120567272
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	2.772127960736485
mrs . gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	3.215095913593739
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .	3.011112087367135
" and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty .	3.46270520807316
" let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "	3.516536136015142
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	2.762486114321336
i am the happiest creature in the world .	4.136985717311027
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	2.772538330081115
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	2.3624296434567946
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	3.225725391743802
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .	2.806649490964365
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	2.3759647773090924
mrs . gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	2.887049032808481

it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .	3.2587268374680627
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	2.466836086786692
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	2.137596086424039
when mrs . bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	2.81340601651516
i am afraid you will be angry . "	4.986405767386212
my uncle ! "	9.92677205472213
they were hopeless of remedy .	5.115537644135247
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ?	4.031678984174986
my dear brother , " replied mrs . bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for .	3.9581617995517235
every thing that is charming !	7.168488482082046
" in the first place , " replied mr . gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . "	3.2387283178782598
" i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful . "	2.9497136976240745
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	3.9572895348487847
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	2.787484962252653
" if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	3.4530915557833484

" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	2.728112845237588
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	3.3286296837067266
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	3.6604928960524785
" but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "	2.793673317817518
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	2.197539551717304

" would mr . darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "	2.2657549586710966
have you seen any pleasant men ?	4.445770462389102
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	2.7492941058960887
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home .	2.6129389446054874
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	2.234559713065837
mr . bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .	3.3880073583377324
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	2.4048062576518427
elizabeth could not but look surprised .	4.861434744949006
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	2.984584425520141
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	2.592159978088486
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	2.3148354785510805
the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . "	2.8628392159001117
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	2.9047977385858066
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	4.738239760117778
chapter xvii .	12.028774447866011
" she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	2.538658484607632
but it is so strange ! "	5.090864768779508
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	2.3373548097104724
mr . what's his name .	4.946529498454552
do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "	3.081913916846929
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	3.2607114117580718
" much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "	3.1505000618118273
oh , that i knew how it was ! "	5.460830721757429
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	2.8582032720934656
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	4.859124076015645
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .	2.424970876053151
if he fears me , why come hither ?	3.7548259077904853
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	3.0781205614506324

copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .	2.721023312124132
i did not expect such a compliment . "	4.186396647155204
" this will not do , " said elizabeth .	5.104059947104013
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "	2.2936833080264036
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	2.7060491116697616
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? "	2.407697874461528

" she will drop the acquaintance entirely . "	3.3765922118948786
" yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	2.4004146409857645
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	2.520351791356365
mr . darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	2.5625830339917717
allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	2.9794718866672416
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	3.143944045812071
mr . collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	2.1815600036273923
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	3.162180896515665
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair .	5.286239632042634
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time .	2.3603996844181445
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	2.3559625050745896
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr . darcy--that mr . darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .	2.624569724647597
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	2.46854211813725
" i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . "	2.5540005128159695
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	3.8468579025031344
the path just admitted three .	5.101765745332202
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr . collins's correspondence for any consideration .	3.5695027443125604
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .	3.4634455634939347
how could i be so silly as to wish it !	3.705820053414982
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "	3.3898347268966775
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you joy ? "	2.687669992276144
had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal . "	2.4925245312663518
" certainly not ; at first .	4.466516867623622
and when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	2.8722134890579483
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "	2.3175344158834434
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	2.2386551795413294
i will put on my things in a moment .	3.6053189991380536

are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? "	2.8525953527368104
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her .	2.3826587554330607
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	3.097429961211464
i am impatient to see him . "	4.4254429366964665
" we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire . "	3.4450795181416214
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.'	2.651341629514006
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	2.211797633083718
every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	3.195077779025528
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "	3.7625548054003812
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "	2.7340099838788805
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "	2.86277038428278
what will become of me .	5.637128692579087
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .	2.370949042485012
it is mr . bingley i am sure .	6.2544787400156325
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	3.7101994530267044
at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	2.3975092689052913
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	2.705137235669539
" what do you mean ? "	3.8813108489934556
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	3.4174058577295576
no , no--i feel he may defy us there .	3.2743483416746417
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	2.9243329166961507
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	2.8973142586076968
no one made any reply .	5.2920509989329
this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	2.851489041698888
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	2.7324798865776434
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .	3.972795931041995
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs . bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas .	3.238714509656445
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	3.180659132812952
" i never saw any one so shocked .	3.9847227581802755
then addressing her daughter , " oh !	5.271406299579858
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	3.7449705364212456
she dared not relate the other half of mr . darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	2.897603513654839
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .	2.511016917492512
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	2.5664043344870278
and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	2.642813142635166
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . "	3.0197844734631714
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "	3.5870404630977877
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	3.034697873601247
mr . bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	2.974918619909195
" project gutenberg " is a registered trademark .	4.378865778226398
lydia--the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	2.3112259937950625
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	3.745352587681521
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	2.2946977284575234
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . "	2.9355264798181553
who are your uncles and aunts ?	4.2741543120268535
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	2.901131947756828
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire . "	3.1766751483106597
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	3.289372345604714
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs . bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	3.3724663906185484
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	2.8424178353618808
" these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth .	3.993804989261589
" did not you ?	8.339591872125347
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	3.6420331384040145
i hope he will overlook it .	4.785915687685068
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	4.273050645788777
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	3.8397633604347883
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	2.517065321429716
" miss elizabeth bennet ! "	5.832673777017133
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	2.4152920932857342
then pray speak aloud .	6.967804819068588
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	2.615963498076093
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	2.596498441037661
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .	2.5523348884420543
" ah !	11.918701760586288
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where .	2.805855927541451
" i have heard much of your master's fine person , " said mrs . gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .	3.262091938588625
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	2.6203267010636884
it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother , as well as of her's .	3.17726664244075
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	4.0483915262930354
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "	2.8556587684140817
" such as vanity and pride . "	4.18981907150921
cried his wife impatiently .	8.664876042495509
you see on what a footing we are .	3.702430602775333
" how can you talk so ? "	3.6535144798233414
that lady i suppose is your mother . "	3.979611742842666
said he , smiling .	8.431752317649234
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "	2.993407702771661
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .	2.903230483388278
there is one point , on which i want your advice .	3.677425965344303
" perfectly so--i thank you . "	3.9750453534697034
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .	3.9847232186887402
for god's sake , say no more of his partners .	3.555411340053288
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	4.659294847011459
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?	4.006685646424037
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	2.605269660341841
but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "	2.5595768746643994
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . darcy's proposals .	2.9901040421498633
in that case he would return no more .	4.082305680952197
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	3.2113158813362044
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	3.6533672127911188
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	2.5434687695935887
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .	2.9316690879389666
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn . "	2.7702607240479917
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	2.22845730798413
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	2.9668179396078895
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .	2.555939899281281
it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	3.0068941864571173
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .	3.7365041504911765
chapter v . " i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	2.856920202294795
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	2.491625869346568
" i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	2.51410344065365
the rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	2.360388855261074
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	2.995613833984115
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "	2.3085846889016075
" oh !	5.461298269298178
i can recal nothing worse .	5.228905280906
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	3.8134513332211055
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	4.163613172333309
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "	3.5477722704563353
i have not the smallest hope .	5.593494424527816
" no , my dear ; i think not .	4.336028487521579
let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "	2.340980583524496
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both---- " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane ; " they are married ! "	2.98840247664759
" _you_ observed it , mr . darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition . "	3.204616799910895
can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "	4.179142379164442
but i know the foundation is unjust .	4.721584665297003
mr . collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	3.0822556805537435
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	2.9955058899976548
" though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "	2.361980410111261
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed . "	2.612124147489505
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	2.1871092903214215
" sometimes .	18.767284475286093
mr . wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	2.6349775441176133
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	2.870710774654518
their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	2.2077437722576567
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	2.092095539088207
her ease and good spirits increased .	5.542174685763472
mr . gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .	3.100887588366043
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	2.6538128685236324
mrs . bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	2.0061033627748377
darcy!--and so it does i vow .	4.434044078070386
you know i have .	7.6486634410964465
" my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .	2.6770201279527877
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	2.7409284270408105
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "	2.462534088922255
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	1.7997728336217498
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	3.3231693550116126
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	3.222330359345777
he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	3.137353104006914
you know not what you are about . "	4.519944189693219
robinson . "	19.194249554304616
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	4.173535367554639
mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	3.572311055539876
everything wore a happier aspect .	5.170167207980189
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ . "	3.511193228740979
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "	2.4234151554495686
" it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "	2.450284646419622
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	3.02205500203906
i know your disposition , lizzy .	5.055634011417811
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased .	2.6932357785237366
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "	3.32947135035331
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	2.4511001533518684
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	3.504541901674126
when tea was over , mr . hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain .	3.2899852204153035
" laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	3.4180814815010376
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire . "	2.952319925653506
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	3.887121374746384
" i cannot make him out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could.--can he be a sensible man , sir ? "	1.9551632345250218
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	2.5624215792993517
" for the liveliness of your mind , i did . "	3.2333342955911983
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . "	2.9037431897019035
" and what is fifty miles of good road ?	3.5426573998134545
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? "	3.6265462981293664
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .	2.0590162090770256
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	2.1184663175878464
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	2.9862213877136585
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	2.4484474568234997
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it .	4.044266584645276
such very superior dancing is not often seen .	3.8178896985382753
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal . "	3.060249719202975
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "	2.534878500788264
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . "	2.8686307935420756
not all that mrs . bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . bingley .	3.3271071885617007
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .	3.188718605281349
what do you keep winking at me for ?	4.148824393447489
" do you suppose them to be in london ? "	4.169168686000929
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "	4.150589403433156
" yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be .	3.697737430343519
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	3.11981929675504
" your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth .	3.1929777476493313
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	3.2722026675486773
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	3.608846558328099
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	2.488369964431708
here comes hill .	10.09132610289056
he was full of joy and attention .	3.9992716727422
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	2.464930615310106
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	3.284204301223059
chapter xiii .	12.028774447866011
i am not equal to it .	6.130529061040423
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	2.6945483459380175
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .	4.031008620258679
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	2.5724684472537964
" i will not be interrupted .	6.372396285682001
but however he did not .	7.85904554234522
" we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth .	2.7051398757049223
cried mrs . gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	3.219040848422048
mr . darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	4.066133539451411
" but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . "	3.0163692641367716
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr .	2.5719926788084493
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	2.4926152877187406
" i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town next saturday . "	2.840971797278344
chapter xv .	12.028774447866011
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .	2.9550936782963118
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	2.9046974525523335
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard.--but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	2.378538765332343
his brother-in-law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	2.5574840332034263
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	3.22081349835517
" we have heard only once .	5.147805601248473
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	2.9298984273169886
elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	3.4449152369751537
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .	2.8844688620775734
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .	2.696129302524053
" and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? "	3.3633733145838143
" if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr . gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .	2.508126099400651
i know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	2.976688785057417
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very ill . " " no , i thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	2.3699780034924056
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	2.0800857300819975
gardiner . "	14.359177715822675
" there is nothing the matter with me .	4.116617772010128
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	3.283546623612151
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	3.19826152143889
they were to be off as soon as possible .	5.72539988884483
he now wished it more than ever .	4.4442731360904375
--and upon elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr .	2.183414645105678
" if your master would marry , you might see more of him . "	2.619314286453347
you are so strange !	8.008870212223416
as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	3.0204280123498934
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "	2.3085846889016075
in three volumes .	6.8269562414459894
thought she .	22.645988266692612
such was miss lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .	2.4613060857818128
" oh !	5.461298269298178
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	2.9396765171004486
said jane.--"i certainly saw mr . darcy speaking to her . "	4.040496197997477
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	2.526109355971272

i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "	2.174982956973467
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	4.452120398008355
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .	2.853305644101646
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	3.014339285971205
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . "	3.114276646101192
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park , when he put his letter into her hand !	2.4573462207147676
" i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	2.4868694258595485
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "	2.8135916458372594
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered,--what could it mean ?	3.0932912497817786
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	1.989630604922157
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	2.3484268861192437
oh !	22.329577332847695
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	2.200962812812335
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	2.552809978418193
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	2.9452183586082255
and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "	2.5035090883945603
pray read on . "	6.720812871996243
i knew how it would be .	7.250798892638328
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	3.1867691988277187
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	2.4924323662595738
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side .	3.039941442549061
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	2.8451284539062787
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "	3.1416477271229017
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	2.6491892229532628
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .	3.9097865181664937
mr . darcy may hug himself . "	3.9516292658057446
i have a high respect for your nerves .	3.838769307882668
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "	2.4799094703004316
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	2.3336969367994804
" yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing .	2.6945602523588907
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	2.2913454923415455
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	3.3342849035663615
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	2.306640763478646
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey .	3.313738281505636
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	3.0614587399406403
" good heaven !	7.670509370426284
" i know them a little .	4.746528363666067
one seems so forlorn without them . "	3.4935066851640397
" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	3.848749798319532
they came .	19.20096806105033
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "	2.704965320531361
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	2.9621122517334366
" are you , indeed ?	5.604045405204529
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	3.5462268860652033
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	2.418681976512885
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	2.515885918596136
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	3.492302468338234
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "	2.3864446646901816
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid .	2.6545015218881916
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	2.8145587830500047
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . bingley from your sister,--and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr .	2.2735767572612375
gardiner . "	14.359177715822675
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "	2.7053971652926756

a thousand things may arise in six months ! "	3.095468597328737
change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "	2.3499872293045425
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .	3.362323945084124
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	2.1250849749568443
i am so happy .	7.910164709518291
his doing so drew her notice .	4.317681292697036
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "	2.173018984732888
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	3.2273098960561666
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	2.2450995949380097
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing . "	2.1536046420457016
we now come to the point .	6.045605489241055
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "	2.3374002748936817
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	2.3352320935506605
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	2.479774013923688
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	2.709395665036665
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! "	2.524282182772529
then taking the disengaged arm of mr . darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .	3.148126540323159
" oh !	5.461298269298178
oh !	22.329577332847695
" oh , no ! "	5.512543984213219
" her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "	2.9598381937723723
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . darcy in a most infamous manner .	2.827576310220909
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .	2.6709397698684176
" pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe .	2.765243107531567
his revenge would have been complete indeed .	5.5708064858441615
" oh !	5.461298269298178
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .	3.5063749509811313
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	2.311430428707624
" it was a subject which they could not mention before me . "	3.647075407378637
jane was distressed .	10.16567008294669
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	3.7484164254655785
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "	2.6513490475792723
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	2.5204953964420116
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .	2.2187609847040863
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement .	2.9189737098925774
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	3.0248713517669454
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "	3.4482127787009738
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	2.35563216329184
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	2.3396803710598104
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "	2.6577333422076004
" and you saw him frequently ? "	4.1365369204404
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	4.059901924526418
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .	4.00792559177159
" very well .	10.937563044651574
i guessed as much . "	5.112792930824711
it was agreed to .	7.683164200221316
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	3.2173531804171818
" that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .	3.4743561366112417
darcy said nothing at all .	5.31724797819621
mrs . bennet was quite in the fidgets .	3.8497565771573328
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . "	2.486689973167127
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	2.312557123015339
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	3.381033999797739
my mind was more agreeably engaged .	4.646294042626586
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	3.546635666590023
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "	2.8210967631481703
" my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	3.078840058814114
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long .	2.483892101254693
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .	3.4434613498530044
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	2.593570101382515
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? "	3.1150300357166296
single , my dear , to be sure !	8.094185335100137
teazing , teazing , man !	5.464321543716649
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	2.5034477755909745
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	3.606198523938313
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .	3.2625075505693277
every body said how well she looked ; and mr . bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	2.7529695031598695
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	2.767225610536546
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	2.319092505255341
the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	2.184805979052978
it was all pride and insolence .	4.730470033299026
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing , miss bennet ? "	2.3049971321049814
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "	2.457070650782083
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy .	3.301237000370353
but what does he say of the living ? "	3.5325130114408125
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .	2.7191175492642343
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	2.459658990917898
said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ? "	3.442642803427094
" had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? "	3.3672401282074533
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	3.864122296555295
" i see no occasion for that .	4.441267837695643
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	2.8021554059137372
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "	3.647109634973827
but gracious me !	9.75406424077933
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	2.2287400988629797
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . "	3.6223345599365047
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	2.435750395782529
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	2.8178651622966093
mr . darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	2.526606008265692
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2.4499529789195784
i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him .	3.613076182164994
" indeed you are mistaken .	6.911918602982127
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .	3.1603839882608002
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	2.4973924380784904
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton . "	2.5489127575679627
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	2.185820029851989
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	3.20311187786389
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s regiment . "	3.5301243957433712
but i am at his disposal .	4.989724736098481
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	3.9938510119519943
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . "	2.3044977154352004
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .	2.439538422236674
it is impossible that he should still love me . "	3.6585029576266876
" i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	3.3145074471576588
thank heaven !	19.061954927142956
" he only told me , what i have now told you . "	3.6161285872456785
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	2.609852467255853
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	3.3019228888866934
in another minute mr . bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	2.6724199739069463
the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	2.5234714552487896
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .	3.9711623352259866
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	3.110700491705117

they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	2.4969479392707723
" she did indeed , louisa .	4.563176302978443
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .	2.1655915130913534
she had very little notice from any but him .	3.3851202331222505
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	2.6342206244058084
" a little . "	6.464034647759827
when mr . bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .	3.057032672797015

my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr . wickham .	2.451841604313077
" i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "	2.6571977093004406
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	3.3105561355474484
when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	3.097955824911247
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .	3.457425417759399
elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	3.0721653739203734
" very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--but _now_ we may be silent . "	1.8244596607660089

putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way . "	2.9099649013340763

chapter xxi .	18.01069171588611
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	2.392410521018557
cried miss bingley .	10.082032983888457
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	3.905869874299555

we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "	2.4795410677972205
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . "	3.0101828341890484
" you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him . "	2.416296602482147
how well it sounds .	6.805297496964843
" you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "	2.2516507416090823
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	2.6862514577354863
" we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	2.9525675190922196
" some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_ .	2.8968993643386454
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	2.334249978821226
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	2.243727535832691
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "	2.5483396574893455
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	2.6808670951128395
it is nearly fifty miles . "	4.140964219449345
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah !	2.4352951158343776
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	2.735999356408195
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	2.1322301944485074
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr . darcy about it , if you had rather not .	3.5392918085874125
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	2.9709650022912206
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	3.290089339723796
" you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "	3.0505456590300746
from his garden , mr . collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	2.2907061153450057
things are settled so oddly . "	4.233532994804667
their table was superlatively stupid .	5.0012375601280725

jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ?	2.8651636796907316
" i do not mind his not talking to mrs . long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza . "	3.258815659688365
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	2.652878402072191

mr . wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	3.217641181243664
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	4.615906822522823
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	2.2978998757860762
" take whatever you like , and get away . "	2.9974684625630936

the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ .	2.2802519063561912
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !	3.475628849315184
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . "	2.580285376218787

the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "	3.0708326239985118
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	2.2100503829635905
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "	2.6712173791350207
darcy ! "	12.301447857731699
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	2.976583689751785
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	3.912721725858374
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "	3.3291011189089454
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	2.5839033317298075
" but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	2.2195261476912007
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "	3.4604562490329727
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months .	3.2111426413317976
" don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven's sake !	3.0850665301313245
and one of my own daughters .	7.848955034775924
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	2.6208492034880213
without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	2.4393317269459285
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	3.909857767382165
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	2.339466748861325
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	2.3191132130581065
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings .	3.346774311632669
your's , &c . " mr . darcy's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr . bennet sent to mr . collins , in reply to his last .	3.2073226888859567
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	2.0018056738980192
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs . long .	4.137985474102444
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr . denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "	2.5777537848374337
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .	2.951417582133285
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .	2.8059985966899066
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "	2.868891652029137

elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . bingley and netherfield .	2.579925425128244
she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	2.488208893315598
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .	2.652274422555413
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	2.6549714076610145
" what do you mean , mr . bennet , by talking in this way ?	4.143169275919787
" well , so much the better .	3.9676626594856
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	3.2790671649721643
" that it ought not to be attempted .	5.49997747301565
" not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	3.4131337535229926
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	1.941980619992992
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	2.4928913556252037
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	3.0496397586487576
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs . hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "	2.5912171841426037
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	2.759267715028955

" shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "	2.858514943131422

painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	3.24052507620631
" hate you !	9.666702560808828
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	2.6901304291530272
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "	2.4202924378603345
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "	3.2513088050564947
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "	3.3060969644262888
" i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton . "	2.8816353617357495
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs . philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2.6582221459256576
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	3.3080710913870415
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .	2.8737992122222478
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .	2.702238943312419
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	3.019220274549926
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	3.0755571863615923
" how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	2.988128919040197
elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal . "	4.351434410473773
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	2.7039167975653244
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again .	2.617636935792726
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name .	2.9505948556049386
" and i certainly _never_ shall give it .	3.7968599723494783
elizabeth coloured , and said--"a little . "	3.6166499437054975
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else mr . darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	2.1519744535256202
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	2.5802054175110185
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	4.017379752531075
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "	3.962487492221467

how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	2.7514530295445407
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	2.276232829333512
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else !	4.527057028717706

accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	3.36410669519814
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .	3.2546791024435056
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "	2.5355499831760375
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	3.015418325828808
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam .	3.451659134512279
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	2.5467405129123493
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	3.19839937195873
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . james's had made him courteous .	2.3531873655231244
" were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr . collins very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	2.9026699532825018
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	3.5002713770340512
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	3.541093745935206

" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room . "	2.664067998247521
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .	2.888687814365102
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	3.5853465672962157
" have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "	3.2187440130993834
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	3.237228070292961
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	2.393571103892825
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	2.4923175250501637
" how so ?	9.67117065362472
" of whom does jane ever think ill ?	3.5233133320436276
mr . bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	2.781327262969941
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .	2.4259057298242315
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . "	4.4051264675312485
but at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey .	3.176652813668611
" but i was embarrassed . "	5.544803749313691
are you going much farther ? "	4.201100071196566
she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh !	2.8762762961558206
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	2.2089790861599368
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody's_ reserve , can be answerable for the event .	2.2278519969408266
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "	3.6937605813449506
she was sorry that mr . darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	2.3868917450306024
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .	3.3050576959612226
" what think you of books ? "	3.59124578441294
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "	2.6339350466132445
i never saw such a long chin in my life .	4.006219373764699
and when you have given _your_ ball , " she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also .	3.148869976795691
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .	2.7856450643922206
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	2.2210148462678343
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	2.803161518787076
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	3.111920695676775
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !	2.7970405460617886
i _should_ say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several . "	3.23011139573836
mr . bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	2.0495490055755687
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	2.187959142939585
darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "	3.001453279652778
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .	2.5577647671721206
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	2.4503492341361905
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell .	2.737073727337837
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	2.601660753286455
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	2.781109617741723
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "	2.520791549374118
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	2.331272588430211
and who knows what _may_ happen ?	4.380745244522215
" in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defective .	3.5156970990032197
but it was not to be .	8.182696252840602
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .	2.70856175862417
elizabeth longed to observe that mr . bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .	2.85769843258877
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	2.4336841857233167
" i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	2.202342791930999
then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "	1.8509344836768509
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .	2.070015285701067
lizzy declares she will not have mr . collins , and mr . collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . "	4.010783455117812
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? "	3.4531636986710463
" there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him . "	2.614096051690614
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	2.6993407146370187
" is that his design in settling here ? "	3.181466006273063
mr . bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	2.465463191278736
--and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	2.7993570392820826
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	2.3285681156782
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "	2.9678439853289693
" i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . "	2.943278838531509
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	2.943123078520735
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	2.87107659369983
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . wickham and the officers , mr . collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	2.5366827255921134
" let me be rightly understood .	4.327235908617486
mr . wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	2.2554487936154897
" i hope not so .	5.579682529736345
" kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully .	2.7977670288656085
the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	2.4159262239443846
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe .	3.1573009544352746
you are safe from me . "	4.35460375746209
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	3.963392090129228
" i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women .	2.690091810567652
mrs . reynolds could interest her on no other point .	3.0387524672423765
she was very equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	3.033888770568698
" we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherine and lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	3.2038108957062925
" that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .	3.086078788260787
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	2.350775269016984
mrs . bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ?	3.3762845006249416
her report was highly favourable .	5.357986462407382
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! "	2.380826735609717
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	2.188684409098211
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	5.0047670589200335
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again .	3.1516433634924734
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	2.6883449916806454
" i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen .	2.99103364720637
" i hope , " added mrs . gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	3.3036903640928705
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	2.455233424838103
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	3.044670702115579
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	2.2793034130965797
many small donations ( $1 to $5,000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs .	1.9444226632474373
" not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . "	2.729701158789273
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	3.0395121839482315
" no , she would go home .	5.774052676916695
i never was .	10.186425483940369
i dearly love a laugh . "	4.270427849983137
he readily agreed to it .	6.068864468225303
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	3.3395496579175
but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world . "	2.450010232522259
they are all for what they can get .	4.433612040890321
" i do not think we were speaking at all .	3.5500064956177106
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "	2.1730995331321257
" i confess , " said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .	2.8633172233230613
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	2.6724593906633407
mr . darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	3.3629446461864854
towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself . "	3.8476280897215793
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _child_ ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	2.0102513687805765
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .	4.98185510523843
have a little compassion on my nerves .	4.758709453781233
" i am afraid , mr . darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "	3.1832491952134516
charlotte the wife of mr . collins , was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	2.2590131339299577
" i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	2.958505842788398
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	2.9928175937934562
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	2.3373255196049945
and poor mr . darcy !	8.709234159184568
" i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "	2.363231068078846
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . younge was of course removed from her charge .	2.835353284810379
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	2.6518404656449803
you have liked many a stupider person . "	3.5949437439684213
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "	2.0514965561309775
it is highly improper .	6.560537217007839
she declared her resolution .	7.2380700163574465
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .	2.9824626912624415
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .	2.7214872902545006
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels .	2.4132931094574537
on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'mr .	2.6015479152935415
" my dear mr . bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? "	2.8424941507387227
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	2.4023711358414235
" it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	2.6870257366230836
sir william , how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr . collins wants to marry lizzy ? "	3.079672976364118
cried jane .	19.660776372166808

but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	1.8128860229546482
mr . robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ?	2.6142265677465892
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .	3.220590972400828
" do you really think so ? "	4.128995337899704
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year .	2.093380743560587
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "	2.409663210954086
i speak feelingly .	9.892935978897736
darcy was fixed in astonishment .	5.701055191097992
" if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject .	3.7027409545402414
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	2.6253005614187925
" not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . "	3.2168496797808115
" now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr . bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	3.4716232885546563
what are you telling miss bennet ?	5.248242395930818
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends . "	2.9167063912283795
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	2.4580907403138714
" no governess !	9.216958366047335
if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .	3.6800883304125667
" the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "	2.2303107996060025
i will not tell you what it is .	4.9654433401647955
it was very little less .	7.493779988281484
" no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else . "	2.1986076912461185
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	2.727584932061787
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	2.216552712683543
" not one . "	6.494386722024659
" i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . "	2.7106997037400093
you must not suspect me .	5.999976312591794
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	2.888395613217341
" yes , i have had a letter from him by express . "	4.237782644231827
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "	3.0206197041053544
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	2.7857019465251094

it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr . bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	2.302488689741211
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it .	3.032376158531733
i speak nothing but the truth .	4.911467411964603
" i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	2.370696311898908
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	3.2630129485702413

as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	2.119414556561649
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	3.1563900779242116

miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . "	2.7297119139265105
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . and mrs . gardiner , though unknown .	2.7741609621937027
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	2.2666801720987886
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	2.3290569506907195
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?	2.6694110619192726
my dear mr . bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?	4.078198471093036
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	3.9909071062607366
" he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "	2.906306634769694
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . gardiner's long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .	2.411183137904054

did you see it ? "	5.451897719165035
" that is a question which mr . darcy only can answer . "	3.5144802461103444
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	3.2285500119681596
" how good it was in you , my dear mr . bennet !	4.720660596139136
" upon my word!--well , that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "	2.098392899043917
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	3.0944625335466527
" it is no such thing .	4.485572372192005
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	3.01028393932222
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham!--imagine our surprise .	2.3252080370662664
at night she opened her heart to jane .	3.7297757351194636
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .	2.8375675585410405
" these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .	2.7148479175669045
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .	2.7199654327588334
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	2.0767696600441505
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "	2.3688955826570894
replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	3.0907692726355602
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .	2.9572036037886487
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .	3.0958428751028473
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	2.9450330349994522
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible .	2.625617460230739
what news ?	19.770029778653505
chapter v . every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	2.391695762748976
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .	3.7100316431347764
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr . bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .	2.5510016986958393
but georgiana would not join her .	4.371392930637862
if there _were_ but such another man for you ! "	2.8681495221377733
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	3.3344857209555068
" my dear sir , " replied mr . collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence . "	2.8370846896363098
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	2.2287838108075206
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	2.6336385977450636
this is my advice .	7.179187204995594
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs .	3.025075288379606
" 'tis too much ! "	4.933136075708383
" i think you said she was a widow , sir ?	3.5745075757638785
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	2.1597308240001434
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .	1.9358009747087377
i have not _that_ pain .	5.762227483235019
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	2.4786947168506988
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	2.540063062294049
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	2.770909404116782
mr . bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire , as clearly as mr . gardiner could do .	3.021730483450042
" oh !	5.461298269298178
but mr . gardiner could not be seen , and mr . darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	3.557788948986275
mr . collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	3.00514860835123
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	2.6472043341107367
teaze him--laugh at him.--intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "	3.3552440981384115
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	3.351574848777015
" not yet , " replied jane .	6.507014590218724
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks . "	2.6588688184329197
said mr . gardiner .	15.618955678292346
in revolving lady catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	2.98886159893249
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	2.140475085462224
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .	2.8806589552521653
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	2.9122006834385643
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr . bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	3.1756766090556763
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again .	4.293628768909594
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	3.074579220765111
to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	2.8886532409782917
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "	3.3372106661427607
" that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "	3.2354609924176274
" if he wants our society , let him seek it .	2.9224631391159037
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "	3.3129821670924713
mrs . long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "	2.447628775297243
elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both .	5.091395040001468
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . and mrs . gardiner .	2.6179596242369785
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	2.138501523333906
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .	3.585667168248989
" if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	3.145862835922025
mr .	6.615068988598413
while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	2.623136048916519
it is almost past belief .	5.195875085280288
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	2.192641859359743
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	3.21589172286683
mrs . bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	2.4086447432390585
* * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	2.5876882788210103
they were , therefore , to go.--elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	3.183405582057279
" mr . bingley does not know mr . wickham himself ? "	4.992459197253989
poor jane !	19.43061246247235
my temper i dare not vouch for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	2.316689145115613
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "	2.799295068220818
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "	2.521326077256985
" i should not mind any thing at all . "	3.0898702297281964
his father , miss bennet , the late mr . darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr . darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	3.0129657739618683
bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	2.274008533724844
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	1.971858539902421
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . "	2.5767531612679
but here he was set right by mrs . bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	2.7000569303468613
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .	3.0077416113934254
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "	2.308265572903627
i know not what to think .	4.9646619644500305
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	2.7989183038115057
mr . darcy !	8.72703993808199
" is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? "	3.680231011241362
the supposition did not pain her .	4.5985101772613355
dear , yes;--but you must own she is very plain .	3.523802833209978
" not at all . "	4.432907193925503
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she .	4.2133024214502175
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .	3.442580257729389
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	2.347150027598343
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? "	3.5843111635663263
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	2.127803789023285
" you are joking , lizzy .	4.374635053740635
said she .	15.157501563791481
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "	2.342666124510211
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	2.7638279839119257
" no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose .	4.023596658961276
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr . darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner . "	2.36925798882822
are the others coming out ? "	4.5053291459546525
it is a nice long walk , and mr . darcy has never seen the view . "	3.561766997469623
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	2.380578086680773
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	3.1914807807399312
we had better go into the avenue . "	4.045528711571165
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! "	2.479128076425946
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .	3.641532466801847

was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?	3.1376484533232114
" that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly . "	2.968336167320589
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ .	3.54073193603007
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	2.634524329361345
" indeed , mr . collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	3.5575960299534795

" it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . "	3.3007335124383506
on the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	2.26202258311977
said elizabeth .	12.977184546591
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	1.9845633117205428
mr . collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while mrs . bennet was stirring the fire .	2.7064280565096612
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . stone .	2.734358916860707
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	2.351014376933438
" ah ! "	6.4417287986415
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	3.3792494613529978
cried he , turning towards her .	5.035327658288166
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states .	2.117360090448488
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	3.1959299439356985
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	3.215877379967483
let us hope for better things .	4.243434264652077
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body .	2.7416597114812062
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr .	3.16706432554739

i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	2.676402168743688
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	2.610429125608625
miss bennet still looked all amazement .	4.556741345392143
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .	4.611021041649343
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it .	2.5436575383477424
wickham is safe . "	7.238878003395063

i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	2.7528478439297728
" when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "	2.918117952106985
" if you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .	3.1222550619082994
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline .	3.3350842614806844
" my style of writing is very different from yours . "	2.8726380414515806
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent .	4.9834972827020065

she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . "	2.6246407684455355
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ .	2.832964319578751
" at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "	2.8318220780908923
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne's .	2.969778805092324
mrs . bennet could hardly comprehend it .	4.087152128190994
mr . darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	2.739133158654803
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	4.718393687930756
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	2.638821147663287
he studies too much for words of four syllables.--do not you , darcy ? "	2.718940658035979
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	3.5728294819931974
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	3.003253352004747
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character .	2.962219419028299
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you !	3.4993720439406926
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , '_she_ a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	2.5906012251147486
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them .	3.4523270734173566
mr . bennet protested against any description of finery .	3.4258202400128717
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	2.688525658870159
but it is of small importance . "	5.121612448275298
" how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say.--_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "	2.5108170855453835
" what should not you mind ? "	4.081784376681406
" i should never have said mrs . collins was settled _near_ her family . "	3.696363672741076
it is because he will not give himself the trouble . "	3.2801279929001113
" did you go by the village of kympton ? "	2.916357762998197
she was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . "	2.442567551609957
" how strange this is !	5.442374896141815
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	2.3270132097413483
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	3.511156015948982
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	2.12153455457472
pray , how _violent was_ mr . bingley's love ? "	3.5470388128307606
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	3.4632664680965686
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .	3.9332544100966818
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? "	4.394469617584985
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	2.5869915384855093
well , much good may it do them !	3.576986660182186
" you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion .	2.449937354834273
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "	2.9667156947460764
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	2.502116436753458
" do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "	3.9703360085228048
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	3.4492004723561838
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .	2.734172900171885
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	2.2223725815244038
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	2.5464147727775392
who could have done less for her ?	4.214118918860801
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's . "	2.9459076408264484
she cried .	18.995910259395995
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . "	3.793249528609533
there was no arguing upon such a project .	3.87688017673381
oh , no . "	7.873799652532906
they were in ---- street .	5.846102805091955
my dear jane , mr . collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	2.6379976975668886
_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her's_ she thought was still worse .	2.7541068296505338
she shared in their attendance on mrs . bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	3.6321421487294994
i do not wish to avoid the walk .	5.330803581449819
_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . philips , appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr . darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .	2.4129897229294692
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	2.5464590960762563
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .	4.524898407657532
as for their mother , mr . collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	2.994819613652622
mrs . bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "	2.8460116817019587
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction .	2.6158260742782025
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable .	2.7648183132025705
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	3.1166469251616684
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs . bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh !	2.6553769360251875
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ( ( the foundation " or pglaf ) , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg-tm electronic works .	2.0975262003551642
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	2.5824975897031788
" nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth .	3.908980992416198
" yes , very handsome . "	4.196789364713529
after tea , mr . bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .	3.0975126844990384
" this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	3.444679494431435
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ .	2.6515949885306846
if i have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	2.3395571346626522
" yes , yes , they must marry .	4.006013283635947
one ought not to repine;--but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	4.191700616214308
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	3.7949246441851137
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	2.481567653150473
mrs . bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .	3.3894270550486003
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	3.0809677907842823
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	2.7749681581578685
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "	2.0455911778590985
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	2.5839969718635514
those who do not complain are never pitied . "	3.4105848031195243
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	2.4400539189279065
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .	2.9622373903587254
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "	2.4797326272525373
bennet.--they had several children .	6.651860165792993
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	3.3406057808069187
" fitzwilliam darcy . "	6.197432544691392
that is the place to get husbands .	5.686913238293271
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged .	2.6966793399602604
how much you must have gone through ! "	4.837538391974216
mr . collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs . bennet .	3.8836547871188345
" how could you begin ? "	4.471955600592547
" the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship's residence . "	2.1734119464108956
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	2.8367581848184202
" but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "	3.28496685353528
its completion depended on others .	5.128146829873366
" i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match , " cried elizabeth .	3.178953274359206
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr . bingley .	3.4542729664806426
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	2.9765729082173853
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	2.587499299982965
you never see a fault in any body .	3.7449315115915525
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "	3.272358727704585
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her . "	3.6188536026559626
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . "	3.1337890440765444
i will try again .	6.6629328274745845
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs . forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . forster and me are _such_ friends ! )	2.8698201347939993
we must not make him desperate . "	4.317996648042082
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	4.3616631640824775
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	2.3679742288488033
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	2.8994205876024686
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	2.2832852002859756
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "	3.318085095856862
" our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "	2.1043752431066185
elizabeth could bear it no longer .	4.5961252036559
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	3.5396357201697066
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	2.4151191834550856
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .	3.526162408622115
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	2.8045776688830775
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "	2.7126951137528397
" if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it . "	2.7466393769696014
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	3.283577852379117
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	2.791943832226246
not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . bennet give up the point .	4.211803534836474
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .	3.505103242655626
darcy!--there is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "	2.5464105322519948
" my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	2.4319138386183967
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	1.9661498780947728
never mind miss lizzy's hair . "	4.102763673257119
as soon as jane had read mr . gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	2.34822867934152
" is my father in town ? "	4.005075959500578
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . "	4.0236592508604145
that he has neither integrity nor honour .	4.784597216007821
chapter xiii .	12.028774447866011
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	2.6605604000735155
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .	3.0834193907736376
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	3.6868242737774737
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	2.4563253925434427
1.f.1 .	75.27981737932598
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr . darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	2.761188299856308
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	2.358829638006755
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	2.3608697282350386
wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "	3.339290255473259
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was .	3.000674169760876
_she_ will not be able to help calling . "	5.023261667309337
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	3.371222638002857
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes . "	2.6810757279257644
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	3.1167641219063493
good heaven !	18.75630851327926
" i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions . "	2.389491025582855
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express . "	3.215036629557073
" i found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr . darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "	2.688005814206979
not that i care about it , though .	5.195071554280137
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "	2.839708084944743
" i do not recollect that we did . "	3.272382251883214
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	2.3917955813442817
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "	3.098045122107134
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "	2.490454819007289
" aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	2.6886036934865944
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . "	3.087222609229578
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	3.3823672875567388
" i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	2.809439388215704
but of course she did not mention my name to you . "	3.621660540243581
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	2.5748148113414215
chapter v . within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .	2.406672327453531
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did .	2.8464786366452577
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	3.706178419944706
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	2.1634268542817296
i will speak to her about it myself directly .	3.390398439785913
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .	2.799375476553797
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	2.2859532893825647
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	5.127636789131041
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	2.1751224272954306
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	2.302799317438194
so genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "	1.8565793162111037
i hope they will not meet at all .	4.3355471309139295
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .	2.392426071698267
" write to me very often , my dear . "	3.9377220564496294
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .	2.7916122822209353
collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . "	3.814340474347919
miss bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	3.1738035659117916
yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .	2.548589877996501
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs . bennet , for many years after lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	3.0829769338251105
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . "	2.614081916284769
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	2.4604094448146934
said elizabeth .	12.977184546591
" dear lizzy ! "	6.6925535064476716
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .	2.3824734957686324
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	4.057806715716681
the possibility of mr . collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . collins !	2.6677429303361166
my sisters may write to _me_ .	4.6199239821892055
mrs . gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2.643670645538169
we have heard nothing from town . "	4.202419069949115
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	3.12205855853457
the effect was immediate .	7.296699015245876
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_ .	5.26426198085185
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . "	2.765868819647632
" you mistake me , my dear .	4.993163148732809
mrs . bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	2.802248111072189
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	3.2914919312856603
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	2.1902139148422806
mrs . bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy . "	2.7981424314052847
" he is indeed--but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "	2.4873994092203247
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	2.3356209241320736
what felicity !	19.478402556277757
" there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	3.398222907627229
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	4.7811403229596365
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	2.430163328386235
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	2.4120682001895646
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	3.8263254623441956
what could your ladyship propose by it ? "	3.356974063692934
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	2.3964254381724226
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not . "	3.516083723932733
consider mr . collins's respectability , and charlotte's prudent , steady character .	3.2231402197926977
1.f.6 .	75.27981737932598
mr . darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	3.9883318453657766
" i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "	2.7620168865378587
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	2.216500647638395
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	2.206745056869387
_hunsford , near westerham , kent , 15th october._ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--"there , mrs .	2.077535026018722
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	2.1489971020938214
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "	2.8202257213286597
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	2.8254865382070964
while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . james's .	2.3297795876174603
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	2.3394162008376997
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	2.758217763296699
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "	3.4382224864116857
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	2.984306409951369
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	2.4592245311809258
this was invitation enough .	6.728931023293336
elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	2.692904391907471
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	2.9085557214892295
chapter iii .	13.82411919814114
mrs . bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . collins began .	4.015232022260466
oh !	22.329577332847695
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	3.093380800425908
you may have drawn him in . "	4.325644766945909
nonsense , how can you talk so !	4.907453274785148
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	3.3825506992283194
it is mr . wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	2.5714415524193672
" true .	14.222035592559086
" not at all .	5.960262768308903
" i do not get on at all .	3.7179014670169366
" yes , sir , i know i am .	5.248239962705353
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . collins was to attend them , at the request of mr . bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .	2.701888282249511
exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good .	7.393128230946835
you will be a very happy woman . "	5.028598909452329
" no .	17.589086482678105
" what could become of mr . bingley and jane ! "	4.459630549431287
she felt anew the justice of mr . darcy's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	2.441002596649746
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .	2.6566309212237225
he was received by mrs . bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	2.3701237967215047
when this was done , she had a less active part to play .	3.690728044013176
" it is _not_ mr . bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life . "	3.338881244169497
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	3.058342527932864
" what is there of good to be expected ? "	3.318758927678233
but i will no longer importune my young cousin . "	3.0449140256015244
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid .	2.1763949475012665
she did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	2.6614349701297026
" perhaps i do .	7.392394419833662
when you told mrs . bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "	2.118848022929442
" but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "	2.53467065091272
" about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand . "	3.1910070577143124
so imprudent a match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	2.689178996004616
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	2.3001421718949135

" to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	3.2364032680848425
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	2.4974945736002985
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "	2.7214695223724785
mr . bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .	3.2326299516859076
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	2.9609346913091605
and then we were so merry all the way home !	3.9900282722694316
" but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham . "	2.9022954809974433
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	2.3971835765401237
this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .	2.0516221272374713
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	3.1062651137209443
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	3.3960795218649236
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	2.808572227650677
1.e.6 .	75.27981737932598
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	3.88701653239816
what is your own opinion ? "	5.359050430680044
i hope you have destroyed the letter .	4.898451640680292
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !	3.70685131026894
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	2.4438211409115587
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	2.8649069243328023
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	2.4164972178403477
vol .	50.62194450838858
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	3.6937961976551525
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "	2.44688605628761
said elizabeth .	12.977184546591
" what do you mean , hill ?	3.925466328105561
georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	2.041789954469505
professor michael s . hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	2.2862321949316935
but the gentlemen will have mr . bingley's chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs . "	2.94093589441484
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	6.262396127173818
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "	3.4404342049045353
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	2.932801405657126
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--i believe it will be better that he should not .	2.393562224011497
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "	2.433441267897101
he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	2.89358637631806
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	2.8599371459712097
" i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him . "	3.0015620602596744
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	3.942865253543009
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	2.7236070690987146
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" i can easily believe it .	4.868667477675223
" but if you have got them to-day , " said elizabeth , " my mother's purpose will be answered . "	3.1261394145264023
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	2.4567623040754656
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	2.5702018850768438
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	2.58165848601413
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings .	2.5118292473204393
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	2.715409431426443
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	2.706654997855959
and a special licence .	6.428746597446337
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	2.481699640762782
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "	2.352164780530144
their reception from mr . bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	4.246536777945581
though lydia's short letter to mrs . f . gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . intending to trace their route .	2.104676139103019
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . bennet instantly answered , " oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection.--come , kitty , i want you up stairs . "	2.5723665106116087
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	2.48426832499453
said he , as he joined her .	6.743782541141201
he made no answer .	6.206616864096204
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs . bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	2.380406176821994
it was a rational scheme to be sure !	4.606798076468892
he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .	2.97799700591838
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .	2.2402858717105985
" no , " said her father , " wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	2.893750734817025
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	5.121582060246982
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .	3.8246193656202614
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs . bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	2.552722125259797
the visit was returned in due form .	4.244094236487132
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !	3.061858577991265
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	3.3867376088155
mr . darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	3.1134109764779763
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "	3.258813650741376
" if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "	2.4682626894594204
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr . bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	2.589601221381546
" yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word . "	2.679733728464777
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	2.1006028035579467
" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he .	3.4101219567342334
wont it , kitty ? "	5.464042932495645
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	2.5166830065580887
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs . gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .	2.966760534371714
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	2.1731736282851344
why is not every body as happy ? "	3.8436903068546426
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	3.63206314889371
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .	3.79768300563846
" at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , " said mr . bennet , as he folded up the letter .	3.2946773799275686
" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "	2.395480199594714
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "	2.90612189124153
i wonder what he can be doing there . "	3.504954794103068
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too much .	3.283011252889874
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	2.2250319505939684
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	3.559045676021916
" that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter .	3.368856222669034
" your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .	2.9978346433923266
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	3.1310772484768683
" it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "	2.5546300217332716
" you judge very properly , " said mr . bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	2.8769332196090276
i am not qualified to form one .	4.191376654986781
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	2.2507566114839657
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	3.6349255329556134
" yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "	3.2680326263523787
mr . darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "	2.7994896240567955
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's.--do you draw ? "	2.3678541331062846
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "	2.6636117650596955
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .	2.963926965436502
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	2.3911205057637703
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	2.1045633392802388
it was really a very handsome thought .	4.966199029889253
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	2.6349539326922287
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	2.2387113295943424
" and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	2.749692701773576
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	2.5225422339982186
amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	2.5630543794659983
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	2.378007583500547
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between mr . bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	2.4332411018636226
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr . collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	2.1833525166991667
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .	4.2967683993688075
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	2.683328427070644
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	2.6546737885807157
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however . "	2.7212206619486987
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	2.5134270391997076
" and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	2.9527542040590955
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	2.7272788494219258
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	2.6103023715848783
during their walk , it was resolved that mr . bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	3.5402354658022577
" that is as it happens .	4.93357271797433
with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord !	2.18351803798588
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "	2.4227320454682744
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	2.195212050945859
mr . gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	2.6389909842339074
" i have said no such thing .	4.039871060292316
we _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen .	2.826331139443305
" _mr .	17.898005401321857
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	2.9333392070317585
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	2.109005702806187
" miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .	3.5385382111334014
at length , she spoke again .	4.809637483107202
the children have been wanting me this half hour .	3.399777110454696
mr . collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	3.6703768407710196
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	3.4201176916908844
" they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "	2.012506196638897
" your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .	2.168465056670661
how are you all ? "	5.543485861282564
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	2.320577361966134
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	2.636778999400416
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr . collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	3.5330847295325642
but there are two things that i want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him . "	2.287550261139482
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	2.63207035467604
" if he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever . "	3.448089906631642
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	2.7409098435564934
section 2 .	19.241648418762324
mrs . bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .	3.2351374738180687
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .	2.302354906597787
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	3.6963512520769104
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	4.948898268237111
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "	2.3208316998620084
mr . wickham began the subject himself .	4.615400551860036
my dear charles , what do you mean ? "	3.4342720253585886
three daughters married !	11.319463835232064
mr . wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing mr . collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .	2.602676050051911
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .	3.2472079884268323
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	2.2510064991610936
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	2.2460789823889122
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	2.973017691184702
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	3.3584660714575474
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	3.047004833410546
this mrs . younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	3.1035859341391507
and now here's mr . bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	3.209728836362114
" _that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ . "	2.474251977567795
chapter xx .	18.01069171588611
i believe i have now told you every thing .	4.0826880338456455
your ladyship wants mr . darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make _their_ marriage at all more probable ?	2.4997971474996867
but what is that to me ?	6.246964216401859
" yes , indeed , " cried mrs . bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	3.4374294232729596
--a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . hurst began again .	3.6504188535807427
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs . bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .	2.585153732636096
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	2.7642382342517147
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . gardiner thought of him , and mrs . gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	2.9795468697812395
" poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	3.46657023625802
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .	3.2848674958138466
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	2.5842416472492253
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "	2.5721432343409107
--my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .	1.9684425552715712
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "	3.6100409713617854
1.e .	78.10272300078928
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .	3.12740686538057
mrs . bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .	2.867078433136756
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	2.4792414312190254
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	2.0445583687745836
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs .	2.1107418076292133
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . "	3.1869240436028785
oh , lord !	9.649233724691857
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "	2.2686186122258496
" go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	3.502497214974605
mrs . bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_ .	2.6993724850054206
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	3.919735157249077
i see the imprudence of it.--oh !	5.2019083420230645
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--mr .	2.0652412850406634
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr . collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs .	2.5189833514613356
" but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return . "	2.5349318764737587
this cannot be !	10.80441334777519
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . "	2.502218117687948
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .	2.812986642584531
1.c .	78.10272300078928
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	4.177105023853591
" you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs . nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .	2.9383277484362114
and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?	2.685012746724037
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	3.3108755513266006
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "	2.674940910611711
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	3.3211136895241484
mr .	6.615068988598413
" i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "	2.8083546067297958
" and they _must_ marry !	5.206230112830975
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . darcy's steward .	2.6222662184377583
" indeed i could not .	7.420432822532651
they were not the only objects of mr . collins's admiration .	4.793756177126049
i want to talk very seriously .	4.973594429799401
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza !	3.087082371334794
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .	3.4575005030889137
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	2.434277763058628
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs . hurst and miss bingley .	3.376538028363249
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	2.6261939525819313
but , alas !	8.989811268658542
i dare say i shall soon see them here . "	3.552875703416203
one day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	3.242040291072587
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	3.064810452731248
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth .	4.11636077831761
i cannot do justice to his kindness .	4.3892867603364
they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	2.4981450543377086
not a soul knew of it , but col . and mrs . forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	2.6544608477235356
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	3.236967828504814
the day passed much as the day before had done .	3.978103574727177
