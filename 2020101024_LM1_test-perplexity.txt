468.4098510746427
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her .	298.03779938514924
how i laughed !	844.4089508627143
chapter xi .	18.01069171588611
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	756.91897944066
elizabeth now began to revive .	195.93345955946174
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	447.94306229503576
however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	633.162848660181
" nothing child , nothing .	232.97536853351565
" tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "	152.7396462514893
when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr . darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . bingley for his sister .	276.82918494170707
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	180.47933546668085
good girl !	595.7792485513237
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not .	75.81706734492587
chapter ii .	13.82411919814114
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	400.2851596511339
" i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .	255.34570388015635
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	829.3511723308528
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	388.60136917478957
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford . "	124.19669313578466
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--your's , &c . " e .	316.392644136182
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ? "	719.9110412080008
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	170.93466839208565
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .	133.09328127301157
poor lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	468.4607611610988
you supposed more than really existed .	1597.951092506935
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise . "	247.86302361725387
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	1009.4346117380294
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas .	672.5036866909534
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	303.4380346746493
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .	273.6846585757378
mrs . bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .	349.3287555616122
mr . darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "	37.175502941601195
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well .	194.02392557162779
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over-ruled , as i always am .	253.90635414885958
my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine .	154.54438017777323
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "	998.2609003348526
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	313.8839112177604
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "	133.02070844926877
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	111.55772019286414
mr . bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	252.63184819185227
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	242.9795835311883
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	320.09965349966524
oh !	22.329577332847695
" or in other words , you are determined to have him .	61.463556067402045
my sweetest lizzy !	3744.7727673534637
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "	544.32678374992
" as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable . "	216.29343956075877
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	684.2418904096336
" and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .	154.243408030747
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .	283.5661630771302
i write rather slowly . "	626.6507588790201
they are wanted in the farm , mr . bennet , are not they ? "	45.19867900504846
mrs . bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr . bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	222.55099526626424
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .	506.0726283269014
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	343.83596620254923
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's .	450.9416511283525
of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	371.5650612409675
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	359.61163507314626
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false !	283.3235234242341
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? "	131.14902746114888
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	215.85410327531287
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	230.1554617452682
this letter is from mr .	162.20103585216478
i have by no means done .	343.59202541389834
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	484.38746354185247
" i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .	46.13188989606236
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	296.8892676249051
special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark .	424.5944665938876
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .	651.945883426314
" i am afraid you do not like your pen .	47.44291135406468
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .	571.886786759945
she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley .	75.03765733353572
" i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth .	69.81194030643705
the adieu is charity itself .	1765.985373190103
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	807.5777205797548
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . collins .	92.57697232307916
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "	218.2500585120886
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	568.840460038961
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . "	129.33961624372319
but i have other provocations .	157.07912095844156
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . collins .	132.45206044334424
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly . "	1351.783083303102
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	335.6436785790736
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	241.53671224723132
" and what is your success ? "	67.16748357798629
" mr .	9.403883896416644
" but consider your daughters .	150.0710783940418
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza . "	162.05981176517716
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .	317.2739664539968
chapter i .	14.194926143872399
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	98.47689569132501
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	201.7653315957211
" oh !	5.461298269298178
end of the second volume .	392.4747247245463
excuse me--for i must speak plainly .	5749.334979094753
_they_ will never be distressed for money .	382.17908774902105
but with _me_ , it is not so .	74.83296105773084
" oh , yes !	48.76798460923067
" he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling .	284.8579424883727
mrs . bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	243.56097496533812
" undoubtedly .	60.14622420309513
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	270.89697654456063
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ? "	554.0185622411341
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	357.59552822727966
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "	195.44620344925895
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .	291.71706506469525
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	144.12569389964563
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	400.0710400235105
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ? "	249.1487832032386
" oh !	5.461298269298178
cried bingley .	128.23429189159793
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone .	439.0171151336385
mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	236.97997069949292
mr . darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	142.2862188764234
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week ; and even mr . darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .	736.8149501161957
the general prejudice against mr . darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	240.43273919826805
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .	259.15987003762706
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	309.2333389468967
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him .	527.8294313827478
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	722.3854508164268
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .	161.44115568709452
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	263.70512629713016
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : m^{rs } ) .	10005.275125071985
i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .	150.97765411978367
" an easy distance do you call it ?	390.8300069444115
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off .	302.5096630843306
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	505.29943140993856
" what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? "	71.37677855820866
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs . bingley and talked of mrs . darcy may be guessed .	527.816319143354
" you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "	118.48086959619864
the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! "	562.3039515081326
" yours , &c . " " well , my dear , " said mr . bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . bingley , and under your orders . "	88.3878691935637
again she read on .	545.1120298646392
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below .	2647.4708686873
" i had not thought mr . darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! "	339.27082149313327
" it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "	234.9479343613073
" i never heard that it was . "	35.03393214144833
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	323.0159778818732
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	168.37729472966305
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .	316.6631805522887
then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet .	869.8401054512099
" which do you mean ? "	92.66858087921277
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	415.85844971896455
" i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	244.38259990302083
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "	120.40722180760366
i am very glad you liked her .	29.43368073076244
" my dear mr . bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	178.91469166036833
there's for you !	3598.146195181041
" dear madam , " cried mrs . hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from mr . gardiner ?	171.92082292261392
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ?	98.60952312544771
" i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "	211.00791485891608
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	413.1596273707811
bingley urged mr . jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	681.108591537183
but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "	159.68802203178936
" all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "	350.1903296629123
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	199.32230336328445
now what have you to say ? "	219.32543178210628
when mr . collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	314.1091865947545
" pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	321.9516282615315
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	180.84315609641155
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	319.31474689234926
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "	239.89244191120133
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	340.88701940836455
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "	487.1359762164444
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .	420.2127012185377
so tall!--oh , my dear lizzy !	312.83899315400754
but i will not repine .	88.74363302964043
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	995.4330529172578
" and how impossible in others ! "	211.15569555133146
dear me !	20.62362867655912
said she .	15.157501563791481
you have a sweet room here , mr . bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	212.39471954818148
mr . jones says we must not think of moving her .	378.83167178950504
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .	149.1821752095871
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	298.2764422275588
" upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .	154.61173066671418
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	389.46706275817536
it cannot be concealed from any one .	195.98897885680788

mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	273.6730276286707
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	421.0995153373126
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	381.0726233197012
" no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . "	185.54134210740935
" oh , well !	73.25465320925237
mrs . gardiner abused her stupidity .	272.650587983779
" nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley .	32.92981409925394
but think no more of the letter .	111.48560998506031
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "	357.9592172606456
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	112.59862382592567
oh !	22.329577332847695
how he must have felt it ! "	159.38513419603836
what shall we do with him ?	535.2658014948794
* * * * * " good gracious ! "	37.953342500491324
but as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you .	552.726904281538
" will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "	515.5327376975363
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	833.5281087032733
chapter xiv .	13.866366423968332
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? "	238.67634226394367
" no , indeed , i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections .	300.02102993945533
" it is more than i engage for , i assure you . "	87.17185562828438
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "	266.31740152804196
we must have mrs . long and the gouldings soon .	205.9591095188339
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	623.5359552816285
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	128.5176083865066
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	203.4355787507076
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .	203.99280155059063
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	925.5516856435646
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	252.9100576936668
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	173.4913483529022
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	506.70498430814973
" a man who has once been refused !	130.9645092780779
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .	115.78936297956992
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . darcy .	302.5067937865886
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "	160.54740248136267
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	397.1574574865972
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	357.0361206943399
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	447.23221351873445
not handsome enough to dance with !	524.1287308538141
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .	194.97580612609875
it amazes me , i confess;--for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	862.3149715002824
mrs . bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	405.93848413297
and for _this_ we are to be thankful .	287.12221586578175
you are lucky in having such a master . "	412.73592810602406
it is just as he chooses .	179.55345501666847
" i had much rather go in the coach . "	154.87158020265437
" my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do .	228.57470736948508
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	556.5832595586596
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? "	161.15596048030253
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	172.57412219598712
that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	343.96302228983774
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .	55.412597787736104
jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	425.90008860145986
but before they heard again from mr . gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	205.24246814347262
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	348.52090819855687
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "	1293.5101525195853
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	761.6842318333515
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? "	89.7883621546192
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . darcy , she was directly retreating .	394.77869285822516
i quite forgot !	872.3481565386212
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	530.7012070656092
you have employed your time much better .	409.71996887491105
" exceedingly well .	648.171105745607
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	496.614279243047
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	181.8546092134463
it mortifies me .	1042.3939990495448
that mr . bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .	242.641835962368
not these two or three years perhaps . "	637.3507797424584
" gracechurch-street , monday , august 2 .	319.8697649506168
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . "	381.63496366062844
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	497.1458599826949
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	523.1632854092852
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	509.49256966895774
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	1054.2942684368177
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	273.75844804334406
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .	262.0365732055078
did he know of their intending to go off ?	802.5727088145214
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation .	373.9113000267085
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this discovery!--yet , how just a humiliation!--had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .	526.3779727744062
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	121.85889621782924
" perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "	123.71836039060707
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . darcy and herself .	283.57758796414925
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	570.1330680690671
" never , sir . "	97.99907726225939
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	280.59428587429613
i hope we may often meet again . "	161.7613304910626
" dearest jane !	1331.61876991609
very odd!--and you only the second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your younger sisters must be very young ? "	1155.6708363991938
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	280.1389921602895
but he is an ugly fellow !	504.51543903242396
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	1070.63851582357
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "	170.58638537023097
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	41.94091315166443
it was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago . "	338.89773248780773
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .	169.29973673424539
" we can all plague and punish one another .	591.4525552465027
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? "	195.8441562392475
i always had a value for him .	280.8297460045134
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" and that , " said mrs . reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master--and very like him .	149.77003571551518
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .	344.64841101852625
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell ! "	536.7661716509093
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	356.1352193818397
" pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr . collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	280.1418737519824
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	446.3904896336304
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone . "	239.6327540001525
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed .	175.36494948171827
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .	212.30409017244932
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	817.288738641119
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	232.82147830212097
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	387.86838079504355
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	539.9850142139363
but will they make you happy ? "	373.14333304224823
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "	758.8575764345851
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr . darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	379.4702515708972
" he brought it with him for us to see . "	154.95202309393912
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	353.7644649437228
" aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs . long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "	43.00255572904608
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	864.7167814913018
mrs . gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	144.83431581053762
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	743.1221328618134
london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	2.4426830761560088
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	237.24349853146538
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	310.4758369177914
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	217.4464366561962
why did she come ?	198.1658733249802
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	730.8757968988903
" to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "	269.3159960674932
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	336.8867000261186
mr . collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons .	662.0887458713639
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	755.6144181384333
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	269.45851957744065
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "	302.8048236151619
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived .	79.34979525219175
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	453.27861356610464
but are you pleased , jane ?	367.5569174911185
the next was in these words .	227.43512068480445
" only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "	149.130619267765
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	205.0452635338367
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .	373.27993328096574
mr . gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror .	169.74696875601623
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him !	293.31849661317483
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .	291.72166513635796
" yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing .	1209.8403686487059
" you appear to me , mr . darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	153.38765061018938
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	319.7401302535461
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	243.13107060807266
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied . "	106.08347315397839
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs . collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in mrs . jenkinson's room .	282.1293271838126
and so did mrs . forster .	155.12169056325934
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "	477.50512935789834
by this time she is actually with them !	538.8085838755485
" yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it . "	68.53111129924463
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs . bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	154.39966580461467
" you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	484.48585179693976
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .	423.49176541649126
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .	473.5476394058273
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" what could he mean ?	126.60260209161987
he still loves me , and we are engaged . "	313.5408338233586
" lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "	118.14888610440092
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	632.0991039221967
i always said it must be so , at last .	117.36733305261424
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	224.15501116518848
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	517.3439732503238
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	314.2483734538675
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .	420.68315888484256
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	823.1323383743762
oh , sister !	261.36597296601866
mr . collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	350.54810694615855
i depend on you for that . "	223.78796006100555
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .	267.5605291316839
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie . "	272.000365878654
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ?	474.6252672798854
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	238.34973716736508
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet .	157.15142513107497
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .	266.1073979102138
this must be the grossest falsehood ! "	790.2991689397784
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?	371.05282393231016
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	70.00563250060102
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	608.9400599609587
mr . bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	144.42748070390223
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	502.15229077307526
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	296.2488019170648
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	481.95422197363973
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . "	322.2377882758571
and what sort of table do they keep ?	180.86361990849946
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	185.67130151852976
as she pronounced these words , mr . darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	561.2616374126304
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	379.19234238981386
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .	162.44661021262507
mr . bennet made no answer .	5.313433677855867
" _that_ you certainly shall . "	180.5391074530075
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	425.66472048653134
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	506.49874028284387
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	675.2742155671576
" you shall have it in few words .	106.37528857507805
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . "	227.0957969759221
mr . collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	213.83563233169434
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	177.80302472061015
mary and kitty were both with mrs . bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	170.5656340397813
compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never .	1366.766886974129
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter .	312.66920575827857
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "	234.53699671409058
they then went away .	113.50841813958205
she was gone directly .	177.01091873007084
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? "	255.7026344445897
" _you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds !	750.5192219104313
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	198.91246405052652
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	123.32016270640776
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	245.92774957399286
and so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	176.9106544082487
" that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ . "	56.25796064724218
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should .	63.98829487413685
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .	414.95964680747915
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun . "	275.27201692097856
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .	343.6730015303535
" a thorough , determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	994.8305015152222
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	453.55806817861355
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	329.53499377645244
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	218.35518026340156
how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "	459.4377426482381
mr . darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .	260.54988615723653
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .	321.48977189300035
chapter viii .	13.866366423968332
_we_ were always good friends ; and now we are better . "	1004.0524829422651
repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "	424.533264681446
and on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan't come and part us , i am determined .	188.4188650772742
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . "	264.8653371953206
letters of business too !	4182.986808819353
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton .	189.41406863311107
" i have not a doubt of mr . bingley's sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	117.19892827009832
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	360.944904187737
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . forster called her , and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	269.6691281440878
anxiety on jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . darcy's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost .	471.0196974087772
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	152.8781251502348
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	114.85810225082399
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she .	37.18765138514919
" i never heard any thing so abominable .	46.31911039326082
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected .	638.5951470314542
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	904.9224633414212
thank heaven !	19.061954927142956
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	265.19456996353466
mr . collins made his declaration in form .	204.2292308803494
mr . collins was eloquent in her praise .	151.78660479837836
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	118.06263190723105
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	285.0303342453474
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was .	142.95606202714598
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	502.7795584110732
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	225.405621607824
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	357.4181483851555
" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	108.43896592240762
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "	311.53033774410204
" yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside . "	287.8492659704811
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	198.56507120512435
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "	247.25616051656962
" no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	80.61078407411804
how are they even to be discovered ?	458.1914622545241
chapter xii .	13.866366423968332
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	562.9465229812295
you have no compassion on my poor nerves . "	153.66652805042776
mrs . collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure . "	74.73339464084512
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . darcy .	190.62337607491133
i am so pleased--so happy .	194.5107455785651
" lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "	152.41875324636106
on being made acquainted with the present mr . darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	431.13776605303605

the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	315.5226071367896
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs . bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	18.29538256099152
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	857.9710543797594
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley's way . "	108.23519228529256
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	250.2850562506606
" oh , lord !	6.120605980639009
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	215.84298360474295
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	132.04383698390757
" and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ?	263.87629917468075
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	285.17620168219406
" i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied .	521.6801470989016
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	529.1599352133161
" la !	13.786655412364652
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	394.7860837328181
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	159.41336949801357
mr . wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	597.2975658672899
chapter xviii .	18.01069171588611
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .	143.41559911336623
i have no such injuries to resent .	163.95817053963748
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "	667.1675085068185
he begged pardon for having displeased her .	669.8061927330169
i . london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	13.852302612043367
your tempers are by no means unlike .	1582.4238851540501
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart .	269.84413100727113
" oh !	5.461298269298178
" she is my youngest girl but one .	158.85716271016204
the promised letter of thanks from mr . collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	598.1819208141666
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	257.4026921847246
the period of expectation was now doubled .	614.2983769842641
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . darcy were by no means over .	497.9009630507179
" you need not distress yourself .	77.69721846522665
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	559.9679943591946
chapter iii .	13.82411919814114
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	271.76567099000926
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	449.0493760615289
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .	580.6489119096622
her ladyship was highly incensed .	212.8696973176322
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	309.0092008569488
those were your words .	942.848955929712
" your humility , mr . bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . "	74.49383940068034
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	670.360998726221
mr . collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs . bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	401.7638119452741
what a good joke it will be !	341.8122435467989
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	79.69492609426248
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	251.3300768550017
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	346.8956370478051
widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	516.766461641526
observed mrs . bennet .	1265.632673341111
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	352.45015882854744
" and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . "	138.49412695125935
elizabeth was distressed .	82.63672191458596
" very , very much .	72.59277475411984
but does not jane correspond with the sister ?	402.1213108664558
miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	123.76596857458722
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "	69.95633248045243
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr . collins in time . "	273.36727489832225
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	520.4749461771123
collins , you must marry .	72.88320915392467
he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	221.20559466000898
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "	354.9780547234882
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	213.36259695466035
bingley ? "	486.72843959053046
mrs . gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	246.17169415285912
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	836.7226930818607
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	380.80672862767096
she did indeed .	53.6698097319883
he knows where we live .	586.7543232794335
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "	177.5778523798478
bingley ? "	486.72843959053046
--and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	289.0802158668363
" have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	111.67400706544895
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	103.5189187935843
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	222.4011299309682
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	255.47612562385024
" but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said jane .	103.07844881664845
their powers of conversation were considerable .	936.4558638512788
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . "	337.75434040619314
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	288.2820069934061
i am glad he is gone .	45.73885678521225
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	27.525844863888462
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	513.3305703986013
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .	332.5336772421491
" oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "	85.65856866307362
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .	215.37947719807264
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	307.6774901668416

at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	346.9745805955944
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "	49.07585302600687
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	420.96356007129384
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	285.04317837312516
from the entrance hall , of which mr . collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	374.5240065070838

mr . wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .	393.64110754368943
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	546.8059233183851
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .	436.0126784741942
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .	188.72189293978622
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated .	495.30087704007104
he drew a chair near her .	819.6940141452636
her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	316.38322781819335
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	272.6259287312622
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "	1176.0596507675357
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	507.5738979904514
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	654.3770873252325
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	304.4159961920053
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	190.04462530600043
" how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	256.3535172554408
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for .	46.01296575441806
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	544.4136566290896
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .	705.9411418692309
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name .	261.3712331008429
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side .	608.7420630658669
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	266.1538403111977
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	412.3819829167773
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	302.069920551538
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	265.9674099625992
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	315.40501922636173
" dining out , " said mrs . bennet , " that is very unlucky . "	33.586777839461256
" and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !	66.70138990680265
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	677.4988891320382
" books--oh !	2027.7902435541316

he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	307.1162092596246
" yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "	94.22329060615066

mr . wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat--a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return .	144.89286177283822
though mr . bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	190.6025615849981
" mr . bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	171.21882773327974
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	367.61599737675306
mrs . bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . and mrs . collins well . "	185.0875639464839
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	350.04098383444835
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .	303.16725973685845
how acutely did she now feel it .	682.2023361672858
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	301.6454365321838
" yes , very well .	14.586301091099951

" with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it . "	307.4724704003602
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise--all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	403.76047326617174

mr . darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	95.92973752070048

mrs . philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs . philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar .	317.79265913170497
" indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	61.774833045482474
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	493.22202327044687
" have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "	242.43025181143713
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	135.0238826762632
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	331.3823653390345
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield?--i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "	435.3731027555691
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	224.79225372844667

the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .	529.9696736853102
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .

she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	693.9406738620119

she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	390.3995862340788
then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "	210.72349186146792
" so much the better .	5.315811415218778

miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	423.8621910557774
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	675.8932968887265
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	541.8019139495264

" yes , " thought elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	121.68071706524181
--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate . "	589.0648189713262
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .	75.99610524523673

you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .	97.76118408958828
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	461.5208588177554
" how can you contrive to write so even ? "	189.52000868507187
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	207.10402808871874
" perhaps that is not possible for any one .	235.20845059801397
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "	69.74431703136675
oh !	22.329577332847695
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .	174.16400992429163
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better .	644.126045345553

i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	634.0450053605108
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	495.8452430249962
in short , i will do my best . "	188.5450554327058
" perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	114.42467806359315
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .	150.98233255822797
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	485.7417326876686
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	246.137153749635
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	236.00337387250883
yes--i understand you perfectly . "	1899.1032635534507
" i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .	147.17740337567778

were questions with which she amused herself .	1547.503584120475
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	250.48701403636494
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "	457.82989553539727
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over.--to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed .	670.3998069629979
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "	175.50217087449187

his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	434.00221618491355
" the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	192.18136170482714

" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .	27.752421641373882
" but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .	286.68825954052437

" yes , she will remain there till christmas . "	111.34401342168918
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	263.0023191191368
" i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	83.70890317538996
there was another reason too for her opposition .	537.7285102143535
but i think mr . darcy improves on acquaintance . "	325.5679003586432
he was most highly esteemed by mr . darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	201.06362804160753

but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "	304.31971765145806
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right .	456.2318880738108
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	317.94904141167524

were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .	223.39456809769675
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .	254.11068040132386
well , well , i only hope it will last .	128.05587490937353
in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations .	413.51724925318075
" i have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	116.61835228809795
" oh !	5.461298269298178
it only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling . "	903.095518325487
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	364.9174715282505
i thank you for explaining it so fully .	223.58226238262537
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor . "	645.1227211427478
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	355.1467611703759
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	539.3350489793773
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	446.5032506035449
mr . collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . bennet .	244.52066840225015
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	656.3375570401346
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	251.04114101082928
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	208.76352406705564
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	558.6815325469844
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	334.75695231051884
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs . gardiner .	72.3025826236771
her colour changed , and she said no more .	99.11898551951596
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	552.2015667819268
" whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ . "	153.77858513736584
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	410.69352126219275
charles , when you build _your_ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley . "	530.8713480640472
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	249.6902264593296
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	161.4695595472161
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .	640.0346881781769
let me mend it for you .	197.09455512558515
- you provide , in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work .	272.78141511195093
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	338.1119225420193
" but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune . "	452.50975267729814
i hate such false friends .	503.75033928900166
catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	664.5155251934165
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . bingley's heart were entertained .	574.127282268039
believe her to be deceived by all means .	294.7686309078818
" not that i _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "	119.94600862281216
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	311.1189291052651
she cried .	18.995910259395995
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	390.25722062257495
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	147.53525295523232
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	468.9683838554361
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "	54.345695651075744
darcy . "	12.21544495548457
" very much . "	49.02931821164721
his reception however was of the most flattering kind .	502.32027694038305
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . "	66.62945655866048
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	377.70857710467413
" for heaven's sake , madam , speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you to offend mr .	509.3104807707842
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	807.205256818055
" and what did she say ? "	88.2126176101152
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	574.9747435478143
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	163.4669042475919
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . "	258.49450523313305
not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	396.6872957936872
" i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	219.6381839379476
if , indeed , it should be so !	56.54184897361063
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	324.5757392165742
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	342.3150487097526
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	346.3983142011023
shall you like to have such a brother ? "	524.2438422361193
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	179.8346887737208
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "	703.1978334843965
" you can _now_ have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .	256.31850592991117
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	238.04618287669228
you must learn some of my philosophy .	400.15614355736864
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	855.4968200671661
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .	354.2307793087858
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	149.58812890403786
" no , no , nonsense , lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are . "	99.89765851313194
" would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! "	236.64990489928667
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	232.78570447726776
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	253.50295584841135
" how strange ! "	24.40052254736538
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	520.4122559433072
to mrs . gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	414.08409848781804
that his two sisters and mr . darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	317.9882111185745
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	863.3195372382522
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?	464.65518744806457
" mr . darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	307.0374717368127
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	249.2391401204342
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	57.51571445513073
it is of no consequence .	104.96260121152548
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "	465.0055573141105
of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	148.30324041822104
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr . collins instead !	613.9020764426365
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .	62.516758353358284
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	702.904369906067
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride . "	256.5897743917892
stop me whilst you can . "	2183.2622009263323
" a gamester ! "	325.34836552141655
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball--and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	144.19433635672604
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .	172.8053959898003
oh !	22.329577332847695
" depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all . "	88.17587395421863
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	590.5435893037243
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	191.43612881092216
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .	143.61415817878228
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	269.54674032299886
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .	500.59586026301434
" no , i should have turned in a moment . "	46.51013244668792
you will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you . "	111.63025499577913
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me;--though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "	242.8236822963554
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	673.1136416687508
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .	269.2470065354768
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise full.--pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	646.7335181480863
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	363.40956914014953
" thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . "	100.74434567471904
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	568.3608750559467
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	317.7297285946054
" what , none of you ? "	95.41081803135395
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	439.9339036729235
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	172.79828554891472
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	470.7188189692948
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	1570.996137622675
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all .	746.3189785321994
gardiner . "	14.359177715822675
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance .	39.675276598486164
my poor father !	402.45152920836813
" she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property . "	302.2246164692451
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	1958.2974387604854
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	446.1812284921494
is not this an agreeable surprise ? "	389.4734173287733
our poor mother is sadly grieved .	1795.934144788425
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	257.4167447308585
redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .	1694.0414857508183
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .	77.88387335221631
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over .	880.3894318213131
mrs . bennet's best comfort was , that mr . bingley must be down again in the summer .	81.21928858296602
but no such recollection befriended her .	227.70550520865572
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	282.03277505104614
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	1167.09713259719
i came to try you .	71.6964998855648
when is your turn to come ?	706.5161822978392
what is to become of us !	22.43814215316713
mrs . bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	254.04483345201314
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	419.4242227477502
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	322.2978817903149
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "	154.05368141394914
" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle .	112.41110049720548
darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--yet it did , and even a third .	581.1920537813163
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	1438.5155387004345
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	221.72884912643397
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	1098.6363980498882
lady catherine , sir william , and mr . and mrs . collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . jenkinson to make up her party .	167.76866186099414
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	529.7534309500082
mr . bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	698.3548393006812
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	374.6617251279625
she really looked almost wild . "	558.2610365753214
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	1777.7893358766432
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	588.7941894990374
mrs . bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	180.31238218831416
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	641.1965279288607
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	258.1275428368124
what does he say ?	100.96752320004246
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	547.2965839732566
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me!--they were excessively sorry to go !	405.15194504978973
mr . bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . "	407.011883766795
but these are not jane's feelings ; she is not acting by design .	447.20429725002623
mrs . reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	102.51365157152816
" oh , lizzy !	9.116031974173707
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr . bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	337.16988476351986
" did charlotte dine with you ? "	216.30673780616215
but i must tell you how it went off .	83.43913605252473
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	280.9109665995743
oh !	22.329577332847695
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . "	156.75555476803657
" i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man . "	191.82786106564936
i thought i should have died .	46.52714993273413
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	339.90778228947335
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . wickham .	324.82855279471477
" oh ! "	3.5762404981170763
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	258.86704539654977
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .	121.10487406993735
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr . collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ . "	250.13235155292472
we want none of them ; do we ? "	720.6858482648355
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .	114.32677319022996
" beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	236.4410095679612
dear , dear lizzy .	34.82247157249729
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	1468.1594799198258
mr . and mrs . gardiner smiled .	23.564015261230956
" with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "	435.6898732327319
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .	125.15369378035739
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	371.4228538409612
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	622.400264985918
you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	201.1086391025316
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one .	622.4299893772524
1.e.7 .	60388.82851163328
i .	234.49445074774906
" and quite alone ?	386.32568024222326
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "	415.8875670534265
" good gracious !	9.3201772054575
cried elizabeth .	14.233632662163346
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	664.0272689574252
i know it to be impossible . "	26.745013150222814
" very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "	455.7149495992388
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .	318.44946087298854
" and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy .	102.0216223140205
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "	456.46194110106984
is nothing due to me on that score ?	608.6593543985754
but let me advise you to think better of it .	277.10595518236534
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	177.19959078127545
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia's marriage .	483.5630725596449
has she any family ? "	361.41362324396596
does she live near you , sir ? "	237.84184351029398
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	343.0376317295329
were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	561.0863199142941
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	1229.2246906972766
" merely to the illustration of _your_ character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	502.5406276362856
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	432.29617452838033
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress !	61.453809706905304
" i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .	121.88277433766076
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .	292.5117206897705
" i am not likely to leave kent for some time .	119.70260597202721
but mrs . bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	361.7445676886193
" complied with !	1539.5864276659102
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	425.6756161129308
" mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "	144.29528975673568
by mrs . hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	310.84648437083763
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	444.1080079050095
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	657.8734400004946
they have some of the finest woods in the country . "	138.85424617089373
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	2139.8054019095857
oh , lydia ! "	165.49747010391877
" the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	216.5236804729987
after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	239.87306509697402
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	76.06535422261926
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	518.157936905212
" what is mr . darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?	87.69480696107826
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	705.3808787120935
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .	552.6500776579397
" your's sincerely , &c . " miss bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	325.4597622103304
it would be dreadful !	96.5432623984679
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr . darcy , she could not but allow that mr . bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	333.1689095409614
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr . bennet , " and nothing can clear mr . collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .	201.9446953327338
i shall go distracted . "	345.3395194831654
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	619.1406144015428
as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	354.50727705007813
" i do not know .	5.741257682946491
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	307.1660784514777
mr . darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	278.7152472159891
" is he married or single ? "	447.02957550569334
" whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .	322.37205891006164
" i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "	213.59446243031172
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	317.6483286535471
" good gracious ! "	12.595556901473259
why any fear of detection ?	1945.6376143309546
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	454.0368494636773
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	230.88731884730086
they repulsed every attempt of mrs . bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . collins , who was complimenting mr . bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	288.5548250155028
" we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "	200.81961097421598
i know you will contrive it all . "	95.67357658521657
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	638.734623440906

what did colonel forster say ?	1073.088162276479
--she could have added , " a young man too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner ! "	429.8230809947057
" it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud .	53.825187300755
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	509.04424288430636
cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "	21.96311770065265
it cannot be .	33.35378322364451
" but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr . bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "	60.57076730788131
for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "	251.18972660488913
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	573.1798333090377
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	337.2794354024563
" no more have i , " said mr . bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "	41.376067214874006
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	504.6599061111878
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	844.4242585882921
lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	614.2244162472695
" yes , " replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one .	212.24404086278236
i am sure you must feel it so . "	39.24295614566359
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr . darcy .	343.18157356398467
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	892.7736720946709
" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside , " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "	242.38375161832798
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "	208.0394535328655
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service .	446.39387407444684
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .	195.54158397009533
'tis as good as a lord !	2799.47829622982
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	125.26686210599304
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "	321.8099652785705
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	293.3453841999772
now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprised you .	281.1956573577711
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .	161.913299667768
" wickham so very bad !	574.735972820294
in a doleful voice mrs . bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"oh !	1192.4816876052205
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	517.1800139192743
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	476.8321838778227
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . "	468.7391249764028
darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	912.9034934170818
will you come and see me ? "	207.6785823302536
mr . darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	51.64288400272306
but you know married women have never much time for writing .	357.18342912368075
lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr . bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "	89.73668059142526
" and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	422.9440537738289
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	223.56111902874596
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	309.0040971018224
