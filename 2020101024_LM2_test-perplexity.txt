they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	409.64773696288415
" it is more than i engage for , i assure you . "	90.61316419835231
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs . collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in mrs . jenkinson's room .	289.790651694501
smiles decked the face of mrs . bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	198.41280560005447
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	465.5163051601284
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	79.96326541471838
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	198.80170022677882
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	412.50451775085514
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _should_ be looked at .	294.4613692366618
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	307.8590315810173
" he is indeed--but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "	237.59572336092543
if i have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	407.1697568994162
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	238.24942351681338
" it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ . "	317.6885700877084
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	314.35815653841496
nothing could console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her resentment .	840.2777425924317
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w . was not a man to be trusted .	440.07794310761454
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs . long .	61.7785270204342
the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! "	593.3470786803385
and is it really true ?	449.9383395237308
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	325.997845884898
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	271.51409407870767
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	416.13604342125285
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	172.0571143331986
darcy said nothing at all .	380.7387243494571
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .	148.54641134501935
my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine .	157.16613175032865
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .	187.90182818169052
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	384.78721226374375
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ; and while mr . darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	430.4902907802369
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	285.47943914771577
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . bennet instantly answered , " oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection.--come , kitty , i want you up stairs . "	581.7249145965136
" you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth .	73.33853603567715
" i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton . "	65.74497172204023
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	577.6092112042561
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "	427.2133316524084
i know it to be impossible . "	16.93171174023214

mr . collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	215.57001268907098
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	265.7182919918163
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "	170.0454348404222
he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .	132.20927549460737
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .	456.0823060436717
" but consider your daughters .	164.43318863485925
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	331.86010044671775
" but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .	319.6779364559732
mrs . bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	418.40766837783866
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	383.25613204078644
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	601.5507868867439
mr . collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .	382.28778074575774
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "	410.0390496209366
" and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently .	282.1672472026547
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	346.4698860516865
" miss bingley told me , " said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	133.6206338884726
" not at all .	5.806876593824397
no one but mrs . bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	251.6324244877125
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	517.8310690300958
i congratulate her .	198.92016737167393
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ( ( the foundation " or pglaf ) , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg-tm electronic works .	191.999839896683
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	330.19408408232607
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	401.8016659429852
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	788.7348133080776
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . "	96.44394280683088
mrs . hill began instantly to express her joy .	336.0851775541181
mr . gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .	356.93124402527627
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	233.2127357371341
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	627.6739104324047
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	400.8688715027247
" no .	112.05516169374826
it was a fortnight since mrs . bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	312.6050046700979
i dare say mr . bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy . "	194.04792920413925
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	225.93586425330557
mr . hurst looked at her with astonishment .	175.4138509293936
" would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! "	258.24710185504114
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	477.5426767254828
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	444.1674332834841
when the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	362.861690719007
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "	291.16658138991716
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?	341.2976448335545
" in what an amiable light does this place him ! "	535.4540899809109
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	434.58069187046976
" i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	210.50297989056173
" perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "	137.31073801366566
mr . collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons .	647.3601387042869
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address .	456.9412153938424
mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	306.52668634244446
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride . "	331.36067694512076
mr . collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	516.9493208646322
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due . "	444.2146612408105
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	35.7144465528316
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	300.6525439053974
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	209.9474008695105
her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	435.96789968190654
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	174.63646706999748
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "	1128.7615387396252
" upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--pray , what is your age ? "	112.66796205750997
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "	310.0441413675111
mrs . bennet could hardly contain herself .	56.2716920722989
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	219.94428244811235
" _that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ . "	546.6235522991432
" by all means , " cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .	380.83092986490647
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	372.58678215061155
mary and kitty , thank heaven !	255.19304797395083
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .	369.4244423170208
1.f.2 .	67065.99694536258
" she will drop the acquaintance entirely . "	312.22116925855585
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . "	496.1824408161551
_i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "	267.194741823753
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?	440.4036567824499
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels .	1597.2862561327684
mr . bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	615.9038473130279
" if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	132.87051251984144
" is it possible ! "	69.93823595728
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .	240.73615774576928
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	529.9950377063643
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	431.97743122642066
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	202.41216903522403
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	479.69810358586295
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	637.1711679472033
though lydia's short letter to mrs . f . gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . intending to trace their route .	545.178612466073
is not he a charming man ?	472.01356701352097
i have no such injuries to resent .	159.79499631425355
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "	169.53246006533246
mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	337.2811938327774
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? "	701.6962499189395
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "	286.27986371870645
women fancy admiration means more than it does . "	1801.0344899220443
she felt anew the justice of mr . darcy's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	379.82991374007054
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	211.25295997104914
he was very fond of them . "	45.69171991434695
how strange must it appear to him !	343.05574482501385
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . "	270.9346504486721
it was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago . "	351.1354502958505
chapter ix .	13.68867928861669
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	278.0921195912503
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr . bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	197.12585847967188
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	168.66107616005172
she could think of nothing but of mr . wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr . collins were once silent .	114.22683616845073
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .	135.97502701151086
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "	887.3709632049257
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs . bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	284.53281778826795
" i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .	218.02303871015576
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .	259.25800972302227
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .	86.5458194468253
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	335.30999602080414
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .	215.5779160117369
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	334.468356067572
and for _this_ we are to be thankful .	220.29183035548175
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .	365.7507459613609
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	631.0574129741888

darcy said very little , and mr . hurst nothing at all .	156.34175080734715
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	275.72939481387624
his disposition must be dreadful . "	288.61547026900837
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	628.731602890765
" what , none of you ? "	97.6167816791369
" tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "	190.4819677604824
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr . bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	223.98935595312966
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "	191.8411439699057
you are so strange !	307.5619489727852
it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	513.8402872620824
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .	329.4182346953618
miss bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	284.54837563682906
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts . "	651.4070829983289
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	373.55472606470136
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	1417.8656565437009
" we have heard only once .	86.50226878987931
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house .	993.1282242462794
my friend has an excellent understanding--though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	584.985823849501
- you provide , in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work .	289.44086607747687
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	41.53030508671724
" yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "	89.09859370765302
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	254.91132883722256
your's , very sincerely , " m .	307.4448538662917
" design !	2467.8506725774387
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	682.8012710340622
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	319.5489625873026
i am sick of them all .	46.00042350097872
" blame you !	1123.4876635822757
" and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "	161.49611654169865
well , much good may it do them !	275.63198533602065
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	397.26135088042525
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	472.2419912090991
" dining out , " said mrs . bennet , " that is very unlucky . "	33.373890546756755
" his manners are very different from his cousin's . "	243.3302050135507
i had not an idea of it . "	51.7660271333023
one seems so forlorn without them . "	688.3431649133014
jane shook her head .	584.2169643704591
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg-tm works .	355.34461324525194
chapter i . elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	192.23901104896575
" oh !	4.947216533565322
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	419.19626350399085
" both , " replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "	446.16514815545327
" it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas .	125.66084976934096
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	662.2614014144508
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "	822.0965553285708
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .	693.1040515459747
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh !	214.97318978837112
a young man , such as you describe mr . bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . "	549.5803829969645
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	180.8688892198044
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .	18.504115430727943
if you are outside the united states , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg-tm work .	202.73451760149072
" mr . darcy is not to be laughed at ! "	33.87044289853986
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "	372.78115175990825
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "	50.35563571658789
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	575.7165294347659
--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate . "	573.2536406440839
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	398.15348589552286
i do not trust my own partiality .	145.73550462034774
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	550.3404501699526
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .	79.04147610259592
did she call to refuse her consent ? "	657.714475658005
mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	524.8940485996243
who should suffer but myself ?	1026.0140600476427
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too .	528.4946879657153
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	301.8661673624681
it will not do .	25.853424623722578
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .	507.0139714101306
" will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "	478.1535577053153
" mr . bingley does not know mr . wickham himself ? "	181.60816689555546
but at length , by elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	324.62098338948255
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	415.0725156299382
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "	210.3077221115395
" you have a house in town , i conclude ? "	30.143692739315227
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .	467.868673894708
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !	161.93878108109413
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	1016.7156929564647
" how so ?	159.23896720036745
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .	300.88277173262685
" well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to-morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	104.46599485037584
i shall be back by dinner . "	144.55095345972063
" john told us mr . darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? "	609.3955772594961
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	60.78012289609136
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "	78.22763769207761
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .	376.642840402136
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .	413.2785087816288
but gracious me !	1752.7473700863807
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "	255.38683349751435
she was very equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	207.47952663077479
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	1936.5055033412157
" oh !	4.947216533565322
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .	349.7890175502774
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .	613.3597776917538
" i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "	27.453835461097093
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .	202.40222896147074
mrs . gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . bennet and mrs . philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .	162.65091692855546
it is from my cousin , mr . collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "	87.19109936827934
i am glad he is gone .	43.972271915649266
" this is not to be borne .	30.690965888303555
chapter xvi .	13.68867928861669
i hardly know how mr . collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "	228.06990362236908
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	1508.4709934242378
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's . "	128.94703513785035
" that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .	35.450757199484684
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	654.1503119359024
but with _me_ , it is not so .	74.91254509971628
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .	145.71834079214494
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	323.60677871932285
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	509.4991799422936
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	299.91566094777863
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	309.6312679783253
she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	451.1617111687082
" these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth .	93.5324676111296
mr . collins was eloquent in her praise .	125.39116520008243
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? "	295.06099180397774
" that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had--not turned out well .	236.11240039599167
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	845.1734751444321
" what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ? "	112.15481378441328
" probably not;--but mr . darcy can please where he chuses .	1548.5981652800049
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .	676.9174939789359
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .	147.2767262026211
" my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious .	267.97055958490495
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	375.73523152863595
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "	137.594349276468
their table was superlatively stupid .	1577.052152512674
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! "	227.00350546501392
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	184.93820309243102
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else !	74.56287075874414
mr . bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	231.17662027750558
everything wore a happier aspect .	22245.282663520964
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character .	480.2388728329606
" what should not you mind ? "	359.4932792826322
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .	348.3856047272074
lord !	101.4427172003468
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr . darcy .	142.09505598831754
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "	310.37649774924654
" i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	203.6773778599415
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "	305.4195280105682
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . "	191.03820059540053
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	302.1424008589389
and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh !	384.3962508766001
mrs . bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well.--against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr . bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	421.21406007643344
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "	735.3631366482033
how shall i bear so much happiness ! "	602.2967141451311
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	410.6670320945601
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . "	172.17522889103563
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	334.801962124376
but they did pass away , and mr . and mrs . gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .	121.19571259993802
darcy!--my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .	828.2694478937013
" yes , there can ; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it ? "	239.2109394492872
let me hear what it is . "	23.327460005798333
" i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .	31.366268458836807
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .	154.81540164807177
my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "	79.95755966022216
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .	519.9882800680244
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ?	97.01213044145352
this was invitation enough .	267.81994327460853
" i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	159.88967791508506
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .	174.05778461581505
" i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town . "	50.5641080171938
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	73.48183404817955
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .	48.061935437662115
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	611.7447177288964
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	464.30984557786445
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .	1366.453597186007
" and mary king is safe ! "	397.9024504948995
" but why all this secrecy ?	257.6290510511874
" oh , jane , take care . "	64.32524261918583
mr . bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	66.49821516169203
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey .	509.7949099233242
" you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . "	122.566877554628
" certainly , sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can dance . "	795.0188918536212
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--miss darcy , the daughter of mr . darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i am excessively attentive to all those things .	460.6815896243046
mrs . gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	248.72141400007905
" i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "	209.0677167058913
the path just admitted three .	1791.4457356425169
" whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .	290.79635761172005
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away .	777.6230285538688
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	672.6326072745139
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	1217.5535246532952
mr . bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr . wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , mr . wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	204.33592992886545
mr . darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr . collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	300.307375479352
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell ! "	534.5631216112187
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	743.2658992588616
1.e.9 .	131759.58972154112
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	306.76865658637365
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? "	174.68195179296413
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	336.3221749896905
the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541 .	2215.7924390594726
" but not before they went to brighton ? "	187.09452979421
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	275.50912553702267
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . darcy , " she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	83.24313573339155
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	265.6137768195506
elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	417.03706297894905
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .	239.15569130678406
brother-in-law of wickham !	9781.122522592696
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	261.3126983237323
i am most seriously displeased . "	333.2314595777006
" no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "	104.49368485254402
" what would she have said?--how would she have behaved ? "	258.51313930773176
elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	161.66543180870178
" why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	225.72056514958686
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? "	214.214218522403
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	407.86155141241574
we neither of us perform to strangers . "	823.5285970398719
" i found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr . darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "	149.40089134050822
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	671.9064117601879
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "	641.5094950695745
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr . darcy with a very expressive smile .	416.69033456158195
jane now came up .	861.4419972345513
yours ever , " caroline bingley . "	897.5622536625214
bingley urged mr . jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	698.7673916901446
mr . darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	303.96739160407253
mr . bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	579.9201274724844
i wish you had been there .	22.939133254683284
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "	137.7982210739358
wont it , kitty ? "	1457.053959885831
" there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way .	243.2252415840725
i hope he will overlook it .	109.78910420991426
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	285.8823131667079
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . "	203.61834920906148
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ?	234.9018865046467
" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	230.76266135992864
it became her turn to listen .	534.4599268584517
but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "	829.978377492879
" but the wife of mr . darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "	192.61347012572753
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	267.19536058274485
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	348.5188260507348
" or in other words , you are determined to have him .	75.47671850330116
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	697.0184248253728
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . and mrs . gardiner .	201.68367829460232
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	356.54586176047377
why does she not come in ? "	504.7113144877262
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	84.37856353180965
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	1048.8461177819327
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--your's , &c . " e .	299.238177775563
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	301.84438502605644
" yes , very different .	15.493190949092591
mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	320.3247716549895
and a special licence .	975.333473410422
" yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	83.6687420285621
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr . collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ . "	260.4750399490424
elizabeth coloured , and said--"a little . "	125.46662202202924
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	852.3321757869652
said mr . gardiner .	115.11078369352353
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr .	329.62020754206344
" there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	347.5972402239215
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side .	587.30433166498
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	744.5347336446516
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	620.9997078211865
" your's , &c . " this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	286.38498053390606
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "	268.10906336507145
" all young ladies accomplished !	1252.639869401194
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	113.95575757108661
cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened ! "	259.3335944302022
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	390.183970619706
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	274.66715419979477
" i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town next saturday . "	118.38634964232298
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	366.919980140699
" i am not now to learn , " replied mr . collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	289.68841876018456
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	206.9446139602424
chapter v . within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .	674.0929623912456
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible .	407.51254055355247
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	412.1504401776206
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	271.61660891510553
the possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	282.6521039151864
lady catherine seemed pleased .	30.915369069167664
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	458.5071347765868
she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "	119.34217399498172
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	345.28636330917317
replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	859.4987059965871
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr . collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands .	296.8943688430385
" i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "	218.99280872947645
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	151.90076921872804
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	468.25592361052514
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	351.2568521393288
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .	185.695976690175
have a little compassion on my nerves .	1378.2772037339112
" yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "	251.46087658025456
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	308.43905605612827
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	175.19244084812644
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr . darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	392.6116329925777
" how can you contrive to write so even ? "	166.0719614103432
" very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "	490.4220844687263
" about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand . "	225.73760403520384
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .	94.60769416500999
mr . collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	261.8860891692534
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	217.44061103876433
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .	441.2643557660258
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ .	527.85536809514
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "	786.001421407692
your sister i also watched.--her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error .	532.1308222713951
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	332.2865878898735
" are you , indeed ?	59.52049288774141
" depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all . "	90.92290784192701
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said .	293.6547203992687
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? "	325.2671927771905
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	409.39022129047896
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	1776.8907679691042
mrs . bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . and mrs . collins well . "	217.01767942943042
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	128.96585349701652
she shared in their attendance on mrs . bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	288.12594983659193
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	499.7035589171006
mr . bennet's expectations were fully answered .	566.7732613078363
towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself . "	1946.0229092829613
do you often dance at st .	689.7603395571754
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	556.4398284524264
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr . wickham , and rejoiced in it .	173.38365304974113
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "	693.8282862192274
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "	142.8550018322262
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "	128.5767293369084
he placed himself by her .	576.1205765350228
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better .	675.3462138140575
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	918.3454217444378
she cried : " this is delightful indeed!--she will be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my good , kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage every thing .	880.1388982172784
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	531.9013430006119
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .	420.25628256093705
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .	222.91646566131905
and she was only sixteen last june .	406.97603923399237
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	508.2304856502391
" my dear , you flatter me .	54.9860537095423
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	502.8982481438638
i always said it must be so , at last .	107.69697388956077
they are wanted in the farm , mr . bennet , are not they ? "	49.822750020380575
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .	443.8442923303254
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	786.0764916608446
and when you have given _your_ ball , " she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also .	139.5962760677085
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .	529.6177666647405
i . london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	10.642189572244721
" how strange this is !	111.47748360095035
" indeed i could not .	58.184542840790975
and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "	230.39563243582
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	895.3998753915915
" true , " said mr . bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "	70.37857274380916
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "	593.858213251863
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr . bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	587.2795769621653
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	888.6376519094638
mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	432.11877941028985
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .	259.06940748997897
i know we dine with four and twenty families . "	563.6799157289811
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .	87.35018663065873
" the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	195.5593830962621
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	690.0778529445781
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !	109.0600234125048
" this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced . "	339.0685218129063
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .	65.09541970110166
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	226.70344194326626
" i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .	115.75980794459743
darcy mentioned his letter .	763.8424482252525
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . "	61.32664369544778
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .	471.3900918261315
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	202.84974170388193
chapter xii .	13.68867928861669
mr . and mrs . collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance . "	423.97496990061563
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	443.46619595857896
heaven forbid !	10202.202023528607
he heard her with astonishment .	89.01731455874938
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? "	532.4779190264084
darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right .	110.40034159164696
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	564.9323461020185
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	387.6688299194904
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	206.61752095638616
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well .	548.5485186121474
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	552.4782554664371
first of all , he asked miss lucas .	588.7113632981565
they are gone off together from brighton .	152.60947291544375
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	308.8499680899422
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	611.0520374387663
" is that his design in settling here ? "	422.25647315974993
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	345.5741446443998
the express was sent off directly .	83.90102763943469
collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . "	145.6632013590342
the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	706.2583167441995
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	221.48905506416796
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled .	471.59638867440816
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "	184.7381718942752
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	228.7607693887896
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	266.0355222248368
but you know married women have never much time for writing .	377.58105213789406
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . "	112.31401810635136
chapter xvii .	13.68867928861669
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing . "	363.90709129318253
" miss elizabeth bennet ! "	43.37024932341236
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .	209.00621114258172
there is nothing else to be done .	37.56790518673661
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .	368.4862140211671
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .	112.88199554891676
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	348.06090060704406
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	447.8078625626865
" i had not thought mr . darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! "	355.4718369953367
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	293.92432792997187
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?	679.099010964282
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street . "	85.00952464167142
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . "	168.6061275372309
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	437.3758097217259
it is unaccountable !	408.642517691617
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below .	3063.6160261200785
there's for you !	5542.228937867358
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	487.5372115871771
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .	563.0710473588166
i cannot think of it without abhorrence . "	105.6874920225009
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh !	1028.941191225238
" yet why did he come ? "	211.60104864959422
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	489.51898371017046
" you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	404.36066725658264
" no governess !	805.4583700532877
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could . "	389.8364161637403
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	413.11805380631165
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . "	259.08550231777315
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	53.69573985350302
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	179.1326340518248
on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'mr .	368.4170529074746
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	395.73583099570595
" go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	134.56739889714555
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	389.31142200970567
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	448.29959181205925
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ?	485.29116373393117
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !	385.91855579301324
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	216.9531290482009
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? "	233.90426866538652
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "	255.67949631961494
" you quite mistook mr . darcy .	144.87284489811879
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	524.968339894619
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr . darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner . "	219.4510128177481
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	294.8991903924766
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "	252.60917018122555
i quite forgot !	859.6419459414097
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs . gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes . "	109.58697870020758
" that is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "	152.10836626374117
" except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate . "	164.80673834143377
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	340.76502945905753
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs . gardiner .	81.38343602851326
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . "	275.883857073821
she added , " by far too much .	176.8266248035258
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	552.6231141821708
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam .	27.818574204960367
mr . bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	81.09619400341982
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	494.05313579620855
chapter xv .	13.68867928861669
" did not you ?	25.913181981060735
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "	201.6994460157523
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .	1066.015199836265
" oh!--you mean jane , i suppose--because he danced with her twice .	477.1482662642181
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	259.0502610483552
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope .	2755.56185906382
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states .	777.5759482683451
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance.--mr .	273.9423341604963
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "	213.99390755675358
'ah !	255759.63715687772
you do not know what i suffer . "	31.174333624830897
certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	492.6903094820067
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	142.84072308814723
it is impossible that he should still love me . "	108.16508555621628
he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	198.85915701300826
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed .	1239.5318675297324
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	183.44020514782403
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	183.85065454437603
oh !	19.31992947065936
not handsome enough to dance with !	93.63263511909062
my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr . wickham .	670.1289895905775
" but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	157.9363873509461
lord bless me !	5052.664310230117
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters .	420.75205830563027
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	301.7807347503731
" well , well , and so mr . bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs . philips first brought her the news . )	156.29771025418336
but she had no reason to fear mr . and mrs . gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .	87.73399106771653
pray write instantly , and let me understand it--unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "	399.1954725658132
mrs . gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	122.27805581357272
what has she to do with it ?	166.84889147743763
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	399.862942309448
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun !	972.4501432370627
" sometimes .	847.1288817940338
and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma'am , do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr .	707.8482224309332
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "	444.5048388858502
gardiner . "	15.194908995959628
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	193.07064424351498
he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	328.1996208772259
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	163.88011246305845
they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "	235.51739307899217
darcy was fixed in astonishment .	221.81251763072257
" i should imagine not . "	83.92572498607237
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	388.5289980910488
you give me fresh life and vigour .	1215.6656245815407
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	455.05192613314495
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline .	322.82081237758075
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence . "	426.3316573359765

on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	371.04864976131995
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	217.00324268831596
" then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs . bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly . "	119.90949143992871
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .	184.28609955128533
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford . "	142.57040129297684
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "	291.77827502177564
" he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	265.6032149998936
now is your time .	479.26774489652416
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	1006.732620605622
she was teazed by mr . collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	96.97009644155186
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	176.92212447634867

" and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty .	58.57582951088028
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .	281.5470384164884
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger---- " " if he had had any compassion for _me_ , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much !	342.74925421848707
yet he knew to the contrary himself .	231.20370496496514

we seem to have been designed for each other . "	76.88725505742498

" how despicably have i acted ! "	373.36518445036285
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	724.7907050946657
in another minute mr . bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	373.8647182513786
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room . "	368.59079561149457

she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	529.4784460524535

he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . and mrs . collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too .	376.23322226611003

this information , however , startled mrs . bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	289.276403541439
" it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "	172.68230425105585
he was silent .	22.59119366272907
" i am all astonishment .	92.52265291240421
it is just as he chooses .	227.88633092798793
" _mr .	1388.6066150857307
" and what did she say ? "	90.11366391312916
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "	439.8284668721848
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	457.71229836279707
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly . "	1580.1397064758246
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	62.975004219008746
miss bingley was engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	187.39909742562583
" that is very true , " said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .	47.36788444728933
" but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said jane .	106.6025667157391
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	327.6790214702113
he has more to give .	128.1597387800921
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	125.25866952380345
" excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant . "	985.7989799831115
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	214.43245786942063
" could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife ? "	802.1377831737417

it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	387.2651990754169
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	290.78117072595774
i thank you for explaining it so fully .	210.79364130913552
mr . darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	161.43156332105502
" you shall have it in few words .	105.51319650795095
now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprised you .	168.1133086457468
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	544.4246524728273
it is mr . bingley i am sure .	64.78665912276541
i know how much you dislike him . "	114.83337511585091
" my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	95.40340392796347
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	820.6864426486433

as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	241.24388059174174
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	1056.794592652928
" she did indeed , louisa .	192.2541667315581
at length , she spoke again .	67.6967469672074
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	328.0973883721208
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	327.18431892648266
then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "	206.34248716477137
could she have seen half as much love in mr . darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	206.10299862885498
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "	245.4908944923619
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	91.85852675562494
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	274.2198293760052
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	705.9852634143392
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	198.55848685144593
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	145.52334053309906
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "	240.0087121674844
you do not look well .	91.21002352798052
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	394.4774285253314
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	115.30058042457725
let me never see either one or the other again ! "	365.9086346797576
" of mr . collins and lizzy .	72.47259687150118
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	322.90598630860245
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention .	129.77808702782292
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice .	623.9589819728957
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	435.46405724697576
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	281.6784194690769
she did indeed .	279.4482821418896

but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable .	311.477937183716
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? "	54.5505632900603
i hope you have destroyed the letter .	168.23611614498327
" true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	435.1467370967808
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	229.28501390404145
i will go directly to mr . bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . "	55.077606077399125
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	351.131900712183
where shall you change horses?--oh !	2144.7069018308916
cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "	22.13217229806809
" yes , " replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one .	218.40720044213123
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	137.67890659863912
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "	1066.5665347492488
" merely to the illustration of _your_ character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	538.3094520387543
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	506.68017745427795
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	1307.4379152309127
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	822.4431726430125
" you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan . "	275.64624966433865
" your first position is false .	444.0271197826706
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? "	170.0808702457303
but you have chosen your fault well.--i really cannot _laugh_ at it .	645.854944023125
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	295.53037477109035
" i am , dear sir , &c . &c . " mr . gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	138.07607397830017
sir , i do indeed .	626.5718633509525
" this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	741.6101233469707
to mr . and mrs . gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	100.4302712878904
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	637.8697987385622
he was angry .	68.93909680648484
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	501.7680150444661
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .	671.315799236266
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	880.9277054368488
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	510.2975661681073
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	151.36687273488528
" has she been presented ?	283.11544434082776
when mr . bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	102.69379675344075
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	415.5508388238764
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .	347.16697040674467
i knew that mr . wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	81.13266290531966
said he , with a look of doubt .	27.540409468823192
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . bennet's civilities .	589.9327069882645
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	179.10849897309055
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . "	117.13950174517551
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	136.07205786641802
elizabeth could not but look surprised .	85.71085137184953
i think i have heard you say that you know them . "	76.7992875699616
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was .	289.1609163185408
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	389.519134912687
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone .	420.10775606355907
my dear , " cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	18.28601875977628
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	938.4209972630115
they followed her into the dining-parlour .	337.5384683201932
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .	842.9585486880273
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	96.91108766120193
the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr . wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	301.12022509968654
jane was not happy .	91.86655652716908
mr . darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , mr . darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself . "	293.1081712661552
in the hall they parted .	303.9073332531835
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	73.09248200706595
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	233.49222011606747
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "	269.7501192160971
mr . collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	161.21669818565232
" the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	219.12671001452404
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	751.0329288727522
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for .	23.82733457773056
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	544.9291917378416
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	208.05663078333808
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	287.8177090838928
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	559.2929775080431
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	278.59122085182963
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	320.8914498941822
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	62.2681795944407
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	154.1401260018649
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "	613.4302109566246
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	58.90912476845889
" i honour your circumspection .	709.4072119777817
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "	496.49179061945557
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	411.9113596110098
" i beg your pardon .	11.046115255312573
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about . "	335.3843569284532
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !	89.00456311110617
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them .	331.8043711730798
" i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , " said he .	153.0944189204221
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr . darcy .	367.5860657105862
it was very little less .	68.57583576812473
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	780.1087316586755
mr . denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr . wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	305.1058320823256
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	159.98347989230896
and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	462.5664888828301
observed mrs . bennet .	1527.7173656070993
" it is no such thing .	34.51049282195867
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .	32.90499446895416
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .	216.80523352931135
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .	223.59217844107042
in every view it is unaccountable ! "	296.8933083994192
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . darcy they had only seen at church .	221.2028117422566
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "	484.2873063959292
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	2135.9198017022777
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	1265.3992334200557
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .	233.8966900379464
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	456.6055996224975
i thought we never should have got into the coach .	456.3236053298645
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me.--these causes must be stated , though briefly.--the situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you .	inf
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr . darcy .	195.6982026318942
mr . bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	263.76867797984755
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	355.9497068554286
how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "	464.15504869900485
" we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherine and lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	379.063471631415
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . "	360.01884663887284
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr . darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .	189.2065816469865
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . hurst had a house .	442.0573088803797

" the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship's residence . "	862.855994437518
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	438.69239621334975
but that is one great difference between us .	257.83725937393876
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	365.89476526426233
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "	441.40668575587097
" i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "	275.52974614313916
" but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . "	157.52765382555341
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	782.2179824171542
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	770.9760476751301
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	314.50832403449317
he seldom appeared really animated .	2161.6001475165604
_he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	299.3329239424004
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .	345.60355443166094
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged mr . collins's conversation to herself .	342.9132710975591
does she live near you , sir ? "	358.5213024966522
" ah !	14.322481058817914
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?	148.44506394517845

darcy ? "	11.617565663992835
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	321.11934891409794
_hunsford , near westerham , kent , 15th october._ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--"there , mrs .	677.7407423720449
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	340.4196993755622
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .	193.93394253461267
" it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . "	145.9948722181662
" and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters . "	173.81000967842218
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	604.623440878229
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	342.8388497400705
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	454.8605379970778
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	303.86119553857577
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	366.5280430042074
" i do not know .	5.2712268175779515
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place--which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .	339.2521666032647
is nothing due to me on that score ?	652.4648522015301
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	308.20071976152417
chapter iv .	13.68867928861669
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	557.1097501945288
" nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	270.26188026518633
see paragraph 1.c below .	1165.691836098676
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	429.7705480041451
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "	328.271886541097
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off .	300.5031041055159
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body .	737.0868572066524
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	329.1540557195936
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "	291.9061408757258
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "	1326.5391919331441
but make a virtue of it by all means .	325.0395582908782
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "	155.60015998898135
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	291.67668695509764
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged .	397.30152080888496
" then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr . bingley to _her_ . "	60.094182363919906
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	250.05185874148913
darcy . "	11.570328720106236
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	443.82984634733475
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	684.2163467796692
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	632.781579461224
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	340.1652791388538
supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	755.1737734283429
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	506.22504393431007
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	376.8182560223574
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .	293.69246512403197
" but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune . "	525.683808959145
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	908.9790542672104
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	541.1441168656783
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .	349.17558614247633
i wish i could see her .	30.787918187033245
i had not believed it possible . "	140.9271542454462
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	418.0763732229525
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	388.3603103065235
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	227.86255929854653
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .	234.2254633126105
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	366.632129896777
that is the place to get husbands .	353.7677884046226
" in the first place , " replied mr . gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . "	25.282856884082456
had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal . "	617.9289096815842
i am perfectly satisfied .	13.163356297984565
chapter vii .	13.68867928861669
" aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	213.28073408078816
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	444.4505975353323
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .	101.40405497298728
the supposition did not pain her .	340.18733703246545
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "	629.4548427355497
it is mr . wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	325.10228453807946
it must be an amusing study . "	215.03669233118012
_you_ may ask questions , which _i_ shall not choose to answer . "	591.4034268012642
the project gutenberg ebook , pride and prejudice , by jane austen , edited by r . w . ( robert william ) chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .	347.74192763214756
" you know nothing of the matter .	25.95601704575411
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	166.44530978598215
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? "	265.8603728733996
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	166.65324421739132
" and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "	164.99350989438673
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "	123.25104564549865
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	215.55919438338944
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .	268.7807553356223
" is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "	69.41021220349255
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	182.84325857872577
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	255.53658481021534
" indeed i had .	24.398479753432945
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "	88.23190769153447
" i am far from attributing any part of mr . bingley's conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	242.80026668044877
on both sides it was only assertion .	1332.6276395442326
" your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	227.96148616713475
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	239.6137340628312
but of course she did not mention my name to you . "	112.05576978237809
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	495.81300584802165
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	375.22431603875384
i saw them the night before last . "	284.33769482026065
" _you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds !	728.2081618518824
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "	771.5538964903503
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . "	455.5584896863088
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .	2020.0142353990207
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	285.97096661008857
" you are then resolved to have him ? "	125.56695892869634
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	160.57797651723286
i depend on you for that . "	255.31458949114497
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	415.5779703096263
at night she opened her heart to jane .	345.2120959726807
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	592.7643787240645
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	300.201625198877
i never was .	95.85031159675945
he was well , but so much engaged with mr . darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	120.57746295032388

caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time .	331.21968372478324
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? "	94.93857922460822
" but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "	216.46895685261268
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	670.0240521562804
her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	844.4188427629056
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	533.8482685037002
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .	90.15816564105656
" my dear jane ! "	34.82272906807936
" it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend .	1115.8663806128113
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	1786.2275826400848
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	604.5425938752674
what are you telling miss bennet ?	326.4342693979423
but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no ; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	393.1593968203061
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	268.1926421938855
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .	548.2934101128362
collins ! "	314.0671077426049
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	453.9627759821429
mr . jones says we must not think of moving her .	369.3811235953056
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .	292.08518061369915
" there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "	267.37974432147
people do not die of little trifling colds .	1508.3810881423562
" well , lizzy , " said mrs . bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane's ?	66.76237547711496
lizzy declares she will not have mr . collins , and mr . collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . "	128.77009563822446
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .	731.0782598031448
elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	91.10314027733551
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	452.5247756052509
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .	326.684751288556
oh !	19.31992947065936
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	496.9290618514918
