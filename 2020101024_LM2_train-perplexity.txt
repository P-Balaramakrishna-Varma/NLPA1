from what can it proceed ?	5.634158382492016
" and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	2.6951503784857436
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	2.434651157747317
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	3.9104186353942514
" you are joking , lizzy .	4.206608869926952
chapter ii .	11.500047627214586
there can be no love in all this .	4.469453265890211
said mrs . bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	3.47602845047229
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr . bingley's heart were entertained .	2.5977228739648
repeated miss bingley .	11.169495621549713
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	2.330857865626738
then pray speak aloud .	7.040541861988614
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	2.17113628083523
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	2.352111912022094
" it was a subject which they could not mention before me . "	3.578692971128019
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .	2.8676803985530936
" you cannot be too much on your guard .	3.694253119574039
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	2.2817670568323973
you have delighted us long enough .	4.457042976248954
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	2.4597666819296102
it cannot be .	11.021481667753537
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	2.262993452015339
i am sure you must feel it so . "	3.7507875482268767
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	4.206584220265233
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	2.2010566270286906
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	2.2459895251479174
mrs . bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	2.6904976698042056
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ?	4.178580549365717
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .	2.8109516969376984
" i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .	3.1929338883970284
in three volumes .	6.354806282472118
jane was by no means better .	6.015221589885024
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . "	2.921468242084453
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	2.591469986508011
" there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	2.523249744152994
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	2.590848284476009
she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley .	3.6347862913622078
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	3.905593532094545
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	2.3424160892676187
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	3.895745387991144
that mr . bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .	2.9502793649434222
mr . wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	2.848135297180267
mrs . reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	2.9047530056923514
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed .	1.983021972835
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	3.0758969475365197
i should infinitely prefer a book . "	3.6018445291716787
but mrs . bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	5.234075577661603
but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	2.177663417776213
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	3.1150196324191834
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "	2.900544001271009
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	2.499391154367032
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	2.559878983117487
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	3.3524791480660507
" i confess , " said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .	2.6697469056467944
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	4.383732613198348
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	3.0809609697578995
" her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "	2.969050289817231
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	2.1625121750761833
" i know them a little .	4.625871954379209
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	2.292535993576387
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	3.4871173209443866
but vanity , not love , has been my folly.--pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	2.3759614579461643
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe .	3.034870787900949
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . "	2.7336326593509086
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	2.6572089823856677
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "	2.6734461460100407
chapter xiv .	13.68867928861669
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .	3.3053059858322564
chapter i .	13.909159726663392
he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	2.536321575540101
but it is so strange ! "	4.722154211776877
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	2.4219280011717705
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .	3.9242171499203145
this letter is from mr .	5.718457874456382
we passed each other several times .	4.616486263796629
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	2.464286005014714
" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	3.88337596286671
but papa is so disagreeable . "	4.543567367788116
she could think only of her letter .	4.395630818696025
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	2.5655033635109104
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . darcy and herself .	2.250395806830753
as they drove to mr . gardiner's door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	2.5624100168970743
" not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "	2.412488275684104
then turning to mr . bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	3.699558689552009
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . "	2.637268564108445
mr . collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	2.1078453993991015
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	2.4140825814248017
the children have been wanting me this half hour .	3.236930883385648
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	3.1364968230957726
" no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	3.7673241691409483
we now come to the point .	5.773552428144594
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	2.0490619777277552
the promised letter of thanks from mr . collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	2.617900332062825
i did not know before , that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony .	3.1364561123932044
" a great deal of good management , depend upon it .	3.547828454559105
1813 .	43.86690853635113
" i hope not . "	4.896182311174838
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	3.2094261505136923
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	3.3485660030639357
i will try again .	7.289165893263407
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	3.06045664380859
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	2.2564848036714498
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	3.1828578234322418
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	3.240588437123603
mr . bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	2.3769949402845514
no , no--i feel he may defy us there .	3.2144828547157545
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "	3.142355934455664
" lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "	2.8096333810663006
charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where mrs . bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	2.3917244200608136
every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	3.1923653651714323
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "	2.990347383358094
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	3.408957801212238
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you .	2.9869715843274043
" i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	2.484500900629019
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "	2.916457461843039
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy .	3.2104072526458904
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	3.5566267273133327
with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . "	2.7784996935595196
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with the work .	2.2270812637447444
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them . "	2.4500530531346323
" my object _then_ , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	2.5096573590293176
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .	3.4577692772801663
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .	2.738994465986297
" i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match , " cried elizabeth .	3.0118418758483556
" i have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	2.9520483152558676
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	2.1068638617753925
well !	96.41377878674017
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .	2.8077075165837457
" yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it . "	3.200049710008795
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .	3.5153155463701955
" i have not a doubt of mr . bingley's sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	3.0645444190752498
" you can _now_ have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .	3.802538587909577
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	2.6050894008822563
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	2.3809289011571972
mrs . gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	2.508205284208351
" when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "	2.8634423699495817
" a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever . "	2.4849487054439936
" neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	3.0142215799218723
" i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	2.5808872839915122
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	2.5788959794159396
she has known him only a fortnight .	4.061166428293764
as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	2.4431477823611343

there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	3.5740288518555414
mrs . bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	2.372423997081567
see <URL><HASHTAG>/n23/mode/2up transcriber's note : text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( _italics_ ) .	2.232226889241258
elizabeth smiled .	18.445211964392897
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	2.9534812963491586
i am not equal to it .	5.717590913001064
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation .	2.254375802224053
i am quite well .	8.8206159822892
" we are not in a way to know _what_ mr . bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "	3.050185023815736
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ .	3.412408797050798
" exceed their income !	7.514591954943817
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	2.8174169744210698
" it must have been his sister's doing .	4.483067714233439
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "	2.1339426993345363
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them .	3.5227982067383077
" you look pale .	7.465929292275242
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	2.2777704887873216
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	3.494307335174079
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	3.4482914085037826
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	2.61628136925674
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	2.871963986644473
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .	2.566856660581771
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please . "	3.0439204942227036
" not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . "	3.1144896120378496
" you are over scrupulous surely .	4.001735391942781
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "	2.272687844043395
by you , i was properly humbled .	6.275340032691913
mr . bennet made no answer .	4.222412000151043
a clear ten thousand per annum .	4.223861974445915
collins , you must marry .	9.430335414226695
" and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy .	3.595479105936923
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	2.8125007120583874
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr . darcy appeared .	2.6155676665388694
" there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him . "	2.690644216974601
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? "	3.7213472261082643
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ? "	3.397162972483483
" i never saw a more promising inclination .	3.5712762288670628
but i must tell you how it went off .	3.5407459011179965
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .	2.286427563416142
but it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .	2.6315138045776627
said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . "	3.892565519754818
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	3.4655219341152055
this is my advice .	7.0019079518953955
" do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? "	2.5748745935465576
i must beg to return to the house . "	3.2785689723858957
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	2.32386172049256
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	2.7682629513232695
you know not what you are about . "	4.396252462304512
" i cannot see why mrs . forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend .	2.9315608230841534
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	2.7415511471212457
" how could you begin ? "	4.1860765570247205
i wonder what he can be doing there . "	3.4719898596596708
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	2.6100720232256296
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	2.7385391203527
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them . "	3.6533861188288617
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . wickham .	2.952649226917694
how acutely did she now feel it .	4.076965769268117
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	1.9686209818560778
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	2.76560777646062
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "	2.337322794993075
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	2.1210049608790804
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies .	2.7206671310332182
" what does mr . darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? "	3.4432797397707557
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it . "	2.240302638284785
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	2.7715587237291683
it was agreed to .	8.296999415047006
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . darcy walk into the room .	2.9936722078330664
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . darcy's steward .	2.477320476880727
" if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "	2.351344652865124
i know you will contrive it all . "	3.219502409496793
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	2.4745507790715537
when you told mrs . bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "	2.1133118301462557
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	3.188640989448425
i shall go distracted . "	5.251949968108178
very odd!--and you only the second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your younger sisters must be very young ? "	2.28115346062913
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions .	2.5376895555663954
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	2.8704880389150333
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	2.8177584116168015
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	2.710508380071009
mr . bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire , as clearly as mr . gardiner could do .	3.007616808827609
1.e.5 .	104.36077079776408
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	2.1444228633194315
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "	2.312096903378815
" indeed ! "	7.158220809574148
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	2.5320112630176825
lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr . bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "	2.903787891151274
" and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "	2.781114471972562
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that - you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes .	1.8181797438564289
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	3.0737307817566992
" lizzy , you must not do so .	5.522139281207814
he readily agreed to it .	6.328537810964378
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	2.5107978176109094
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	3.250459055320566
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	3.490964032933828
we must not all expect jane's good fortune . "	3.008542554924979
chapter viii .	11.504358223205136
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs . bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	2.3195959611006547
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	3.488664202110413
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .	3.406550844149543
" why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .	3.7234026970019762
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .	3.9740122585821904
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .	2.486281149654821
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	3.032578049111179
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	2.698696320506647
with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs . bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord !	2.135439328136884
" i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . "	2.0691728327124546
chapter xvii .	13.68867928861669
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .	3.0485194586170152
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	2.644605553489867
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .	3.646184605834568
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?	3.1798072467940406
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr . darcy , and mr . darcy only , entered the room .	2.727104294304628
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	2.4929869836866296
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs . forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . forster and me are _such_ friends ! )	2.917439322724113
mr . wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	2.7380545940216297
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .	3.2897872347371924
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding .	3.3668992296211626
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	2.2270028394086077
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	2.224962076172441
" i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "	2.733746868098467
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	4.835549390466123
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	2.257234267472741
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	2.784936543388225
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . darcy looked up .	3.3477015892338344
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane--one does not often see any body better looking .	2.806412778264084
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	2.5991675817003514
" lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "	2.5296691897174624
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .	2.737111199940156
have you seen any pleasant men ?	4.4119512146951605
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	2.466360113232008
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	2.9174802226672374
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .	2.5813861928615394
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	2.6326989895924786
mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	2.0603117329346485
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .	1.6291152028844391
mrs . bennet's best comfort was , that mr . bingley must be down again in the summer .	3.19027733552343
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	2.7677546372722586
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "	2.234794891675878
we can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	2.2859264931650154
" i should not be surprised , " said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "	3.669126597444009
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain ?	2.733366787437716
" and do you like her ? "	3.7030455995068134
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	2.6027106118998034
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	3.3191105181890594
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .	2.5910738776604965
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	3.2146111910951407
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	2.5418730415346906
but i dare not hope it .	5.771912156110285
" if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	2.4617911287704315
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr . darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one , whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is impossible .	2.4681896454284606
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .	2.7180813962750263
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone . "	2.4146945859623665
the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	2.4853361693069904
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	2.642609045989552
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	2.9576878037439776
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "	2.6558510465581735
give me farther particulars .	8.926266096069153
but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "	3.413670661329683
1.e.8 .	106.40477774717235
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?	2.5978318821929895
" yes .	20.408057674794858
why jane--you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !	2.994620901000587
" removed ! "	10.405357008613421
every thing nourishes what is strong already .	3.7435575673131267
i will take care of myself , and of mr . wickham too .	5.7981678567215225
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	2.7597727655614426
" i will not be interrupted .	6.07035581331914
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people's remarks . "	3.605949231978617
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	3.114207042451894
there is one point , on which i want your advice .	3.8220487113579082
hurst . "	24.431436734961046
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	3.355732200845847
this room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	2.5845740240173543
its business office is located at 809 north 1500 west , salt lake city , ut 84116 , ( 801 ) 596-1887 .	1.8267010666392072
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	3.6542531350508622
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr . bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	2.370894914255463
his belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	2.5561158833337068
mrs . bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .	2.9474475172314087
the officers will find women better worth their notice .	3.108146667698501
" and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "	2.5104683345820407
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	3.4432447259152585
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	2.7857525162760264
" and so was i . "	4.5598520936858336
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	1.907273115001293
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .	3.0863314490733753
mr . philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	2.806619818537692
he still loves me , and we are engaged . "	4.61726799794684
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	2.0930150821354765
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	2.173376993095144
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	3.258067891745923
it was over at last however .	4.673155531646285
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "	3.199755520631427
it amazes me , i confess;--for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	2.954665149013087
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	3.325668887414744
" my dear mr . bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	2.604128992674321
mr . collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	2.530900073349301
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	2.5063911028312136
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs . bennet , for many years after lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	2.9579713162459975
mr . wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr . collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	2.8594435389736352
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "	3.136714325763668
mrs . bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	2.1550994676644004
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	2.045410489684522
yes , " said elizabeth drily--"mr . darcy is uncommonly kind to mr . bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "	3.1434124736805344
wretched , wretched , mistake ! "	4.696013436110874
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	2.680043527280401
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	2.299885867325256
" and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . "	3.1156628681432323
the rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	2.283202341538227
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	2.897860135439323
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	3.0880177898417465
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield?--i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "	2.051743409765382
" yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	3.5014102012648496
" can i have the carriage ? "	5.276130262176656
i enquired after their brother , of course .	5.224034471672872
" i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	3.398743737812668
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	2.868542102361966
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	4.261035623371598
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	2.82265096473373
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "	2.951755598269023
" if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "	2.562764928240051
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	2.8035869629984997
mr . darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	2.539707236416512
we acted with the best intentions . "	3.9945181278552195
" heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me such an evil . "	2.066044923303454
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	3.1549949675385927
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	2.438840160764329
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .	3.0074412965877584
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	3.0105077628099552
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	2.7026030141627677
you have a sweet room here , mr . bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	3.2533762718582175
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .	3.6268414457288256
you have done all this !	7.079444790603968
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	2.8922511958401067
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	3.79872084252061
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic works .	2.1798989111954854
it would have been strange if they had .	4.330874722047011
" yes , indeed , " cried mrs . bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	3.2969771704110875
she is not such a simpleton .	6.0478977499504225
the dejection was almost universal .	5.438302726147101
how well it sounds .	6.994011103305707
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	4.094234741478901
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .	4.097222343294976
but that is not the case _here_ .	5.905559468715029
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right .	2.281404134571668
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	2.6710042961599396
end of the second volume .	7.286106414553493
mrs . reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	3.0660269820635566
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	2.474377293405711
five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing .	3.1311460229442423
mr . bennet treated the matter differently .	4.583959377193101
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	2.8432669796565575
" obstinate , headstrong girl !	5.388824119127256
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	2.663791009486912
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	2.9873165078860824
" it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "	2.4236758274094723
" the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it ? "	2.582686026209039
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 , " information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation . "	1.813790832417176
mr . darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	2.5029831974393923
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	2.5650739346616334
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	3.7809499045458104
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	3.504616816268703
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs . collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	2.6492549058384145
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	3.334824520502682
while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	2.4578481430823866
" i do not believe mrs . long will do any such thing .	2.9995719870899875
have you had any flirting ?	5.769474013881211
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	3.2108980184731077
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however . "	2.7066430208468044
what a fine thing for our girls ! "	3.3848706508511675
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ .	3.09610425443139
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	3.7161092399739157
mrs . gardiner abused her stupidity .	4.649197397332447
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	3.2374030882682785
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	2.1524101730733367
she was wild to be at home--to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	2.1679940913035383
--cried elizabeth .	24.27607852659188
what will wickham say ?	6.593476741095006
but , alas !	9.433446640539335
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	2.601158142186463
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "	3.641263045415679
such doings discomposed mr . bennet exceedingly .	6.472536443480278
mrs . reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	3.3925634293396154
" my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do .	2.4213477264313203
oh !	19.31992947065936
the effect was immediate .	7.447562658252017
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr . bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw .	3.357889625732627
" your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	3.7901787168529695
" very much . "	6.696208804880736
" hate you !	11.110314950279978
" ah !	14.322481058817914
it is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	2.470222981931787
" no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "	3.4398288655134754
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	2.378862999747729
were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	2.720193461500994
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	2.729346049260727
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	2.39701150835015
i was uncomfortable enough .	6.651235297111754
she was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . "	2.4038725528838683
your idea of the ponies is delightful .	4.8118456293518905
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ? "	3.6102206662391647
have not you always hated him ? "	4.0372482511835015
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	2.9516450001159202
his temptation is not adequate to the risk . "	3.186172521557559
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "	3.9911802038257456
pride & prejudice .	9.597076709627647
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	2.9349845706920186
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	2.434210111491477
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	3.2464467962926835
the girls stared at their father .	4.702152771966096
if he fears me , why come hither ?	3.722158568112396
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	2.6374264042906046
mrs . hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	3.3176437883242356
" exceedingly well .	11.04941958318813
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr . bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	2.3381731574504108
oh !	19.31992947065936
" dear lizzy ! "	6.494710127627133
" if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	3.2043037023891556
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	2.977372610802945
chapter vi .	11.504358223205136
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	2.2790032082460274
" such as vanity and pride . "	4.140398239445092
it must be my uncle's doings !	5.650359079623735
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	3.97067019278802
she has two nieces of her own .	5.3276088873670675
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	2.996698560591637
said elizabeth .	11.538449393955492
" they will join me early to-morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr . bingley and his sisters . "	2.402803011069943
mr . wickham began the subject himself .	4.47175074230843
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "	2.6457146329135104
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "	2.8042242427120416

" very true , indeed;--and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "	2.263666240348336
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr . wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	2.9809640569379945
thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	2.4435338590886877
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr . darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	2.068467151819058
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	2.2248095118467126
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master .	3.5466634238460184
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	2.4029660876459347
she will be taken good care of .	4.271350784923681
how mr . darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	6.361005431965305
" i do not recollect that we did . "	3.2547670724348667
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .	2.491852735281143
" they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "	1.9887322659509974
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	2.9860421517088698
well , how pleased i am !	4.746790524104421
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states .	2.548767801019814
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	2.6959209802759574
" but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham . "	2.7710137820334464
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	2.6826524550503623
" she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley .	4.047672025173967
" and pray may i ask ? "	3.867983025207498
a lively imagination soon settled it all .	4.121246859468231
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise full.--pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	2.1311203100377596
only think !	19.84718530507483
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	2.156353710433694
single , my dear , to be sure !	8.526429762938426
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	2.544127515563035
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	3.193807559684799
i can recal nothing worse .	5.235530791079713
" really , mr . collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly .	3.703463186631169
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr . denny comes back from town . "	3.1931744813032057
but mr . gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	2.5612246496608666
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	3.4060668806938716
i am not at all afraid of her dying .	3.996335328324007
their powers of conversation were considerable .	4.566745332900886
" and may i ask ? "	4.31984701533968
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express . "	3.100526104078306
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	2.265716298058641
mr . wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat--a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return .	2.9822535893976196
after a short silence , the lady first spoke .	3.541506438980739
" i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth .	2.7384170993146753
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ?	2.112142423356359
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid .	2.1333992124719945
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	4.4101595796840956
general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works .	4.822456508030193
--and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	2.707749810968338
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . "	3.087147395129549
but here he was set right by mrs . bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	2.635868486433049
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	2.8151952994498113
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "	2.870617564622668
mary and kitty were both with mrs . bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .	3.5233887773999837
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	1.8199200393173676
chapter xviii .	11.504358223205136
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr . collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	2.566988585213219
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr .	2.688466504761746
but what is that to me ?	5.857229442569414

" all!--what , all five out at once ?	3.6500115567486295
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	2.415478500782483
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr .	2.2300401281777242
mr . darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .	2.879640201810738
every body said how well she looked ; and mr . bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	2.7881794846838037
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "	3.439988686357351
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .

and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	2.460155631212872
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased .	2.5118485313730963
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again .	2.5963843977247305
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .	3.7063104068060637

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .	3.6084709953801006
they insist also on my seeing mr . jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	2.2482503464466035
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	2.1919975405471828
in spite of having been at st . james's , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	2.3919187276631675
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "	2.658024564666021
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	2.6910168926045253
" then , who taught you ?	4.606670942000614
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !	2.222938090637093
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs . hurst were going out .	3.500269571871397
" undoubtedly .	19.010258370702232

all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	3.1580380710177054
" you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him . "	2.3372403327442317
" that is to say , you had given your permission .	4.186060415871415
mrs . bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	3.5278683016476946

if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	2.387122837010619
" no more have i , " said mr . bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "	3.3146794401699013
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "	3.0955573725488397

they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas .	2.1931854965183453
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .	3.5586116013724043
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	2.1385114452054896
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	1.9026082993126412
chapter xxiii .	20.50194744890955
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	2.581553920379483
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	2.5037781809210844
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	3.7680913165291376
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . collins's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "	2.337140323108505
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . "	2.577820220622029
of having another daughter married to mr . collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	3.2651241930028014
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn . "	2.7156253410900084
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	2.2360527660219987
chapter xvii .	13.68867928861669
" if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr . gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .	2.4767852622649684
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	4.4403346553416325
mr . bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	3.0106062408114216
yet he is _such_ a man ! "	4.364340480790151
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "	3.5737192058376723
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	2.362341161978621
then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "	1.839845040715542
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .	4.223566796216821
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .	2.9921655394418867
mr . collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	2.112701725998201
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "	2.5858455058098087
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	2.7091603518483507
mr . darcy may hug himself . "	4.0562780809028345
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .	3.1563365056430235
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	2.5596847049524505
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	3.114384381518156
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .	3.156432667425573
see 42671-h.htm or 42671-h.zip : ( <URL>-h/42671-h.htm ) or ( <URL>-h.zip ) images of the original pages are available through internet archive .	1.9049556646625592
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	2.732398100474408
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	2.052443136644844
" you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr .	2.3681500978562027
he came to tell mr . gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .	3.3868732687652403
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	3.1505994140265914
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "	2.127661494226267
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	2.609309515386329
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	3.364609547856041
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	2.616287000914965
they were in ---- street .	5.829564664826602
there was no arguing upon such a project .	3.764243289295241
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	2.168051164181663
anxiety on jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . darcy's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost .	2.5733027387886924
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	2.2562969755440134
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	2.71415703669219
" you write uncommonly fast . "	4.192360047898262
human nature is so prone to fall into it !	3.670204842936089
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	3.2813882967401393
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . "	2.88376487022774
lydia's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	2.4929737938716348
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	3.645697048154298
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	2.9035212399414325
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	2.888675703585323
this is the estimation in which you hold me !	3.5713463204760214
chapter xvi .	13.68867928861669
" you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "	2.6909083687404225
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "	2.546507109137156
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . "	2.2579214417237
mr . bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . bingley .	3.871928698052759
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr . bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	2.877427434364805
and gravely glancing at mr . darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i shall keep mine to swell my song . "	2.10475017561363
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--i believe it will be better that he should not .	2.356295064410694
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire .	2.947391215738103
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into . "	2.727518766493888
" yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word . "	2.8001720517092634
after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	2.269292640701892
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	2.915682064395647
" project gutenberg " is a registered trademark .	4.464017109113764
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me .	3.05803783626858
" in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "	2.9161941380396366
this must be the grossest falsehood ! "	4.8138067091454735
said her mother .	15.089121925134434
" i never heard any thing so abominable .	3.3607896922997447
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?	2.8662045895690516
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "	4.0694421958027345
" it is a long time , mr . bingley , since you went away , " said mrs . bennet .	3.8941429903099567
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr . bingley , if she could .	3.9731889655149857
it is useless to talk of it . "	3.7869900329845785
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	2.3871435340978664
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	3.5838267351751707
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "	3.110631406675946
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . "	3.887413480879402
the loss of her daughter made mrs . bennet very dull for several days .	3.926209648732674
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . "	2.7362536064161063
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	2.2764930793674925
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy .	3.4920082034841653
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .	3.5167042339451613
my fingers wait your orders . "	4.186923444657877
it was unpardonable .	9.840739667644335
mrs . bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	3.349755330631414
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	2.5047770521531287
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance .	2.870265962102174
you shall hear what she says . "	4.182902890369552
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	2.4743483753384736
but however he did not .	7.835354545751489
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	2.347390620727053
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection.--he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning.--the part which i acted , is now to be explained.--his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice.--i described , and enforced them earnestly.--but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	1.9159937295756408
" yes , yes , they must marry .	4.077510595592302
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	2.1557055222425503
" good heaven !	7.152029542122883
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	3.252855105072074
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	2.866681201041996
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	2.893900439302259
but no such recollection befriended her .	4.106377749957904
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	2.950075095829945
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	3.310480491589525
what could she mean by it ?	4.668549756857669
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs . gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	2.704459291223528
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	3.774130040983306
his character was decided .	6.3174668447752245
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	2.962255504891908
you are safe from me . "	4.325047152726631
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law . "	2.8643609921549387
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	3.03690853652203
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	2.2963063126596537
" you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .	3.2526046546560012
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	2.4910202497434812
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .	2.701680329120102
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr . darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home .	2.8994685350247225
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	2.6089894951939114
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	2.8120726080620067
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .	4.6281745989592835
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	2.7737048367974584
" well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?	2.8561452701799293
cried mrs . gardiner .	11.382480789517777
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him .	2.1959139695681755
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	4.492682049950223
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "	2.348529468150641
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	2.531614076357764
my dear jane , mr . collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	2.558900234092962
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham!--imagine our surprise .	2.3034562310615954
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too much .	3.1189106456343527
" as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ .	3.2379174435994242
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .	2.538418680718604
they came .	21.797580419865984
_that_ is all to be forgot .	4.893368011094684
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	2.677983790494893
darcy . "	11.570328720106236
" something very much to the purpose of course .	4.912355557408839
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	2.9919619144583978
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	4.066060976470627
and what do you think she said besides ?	4.4418106871308956
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	3.2093775282257537

let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "	2.4813966967187575
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	2.7728021202147004
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs . bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas .	3.1719441666690917
mr . wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	3.0209778376492906
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .	2.5422247546618455
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "	2.9735132503435504
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	2.4979970083400698
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	1.9792266725785104

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	2.1327569397491972
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	2.321478914559205
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	3.215678382434363
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	3.4421959686162964
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	2.6087691008982046
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	2.401929464142724
your's , &c . " edw .	4.657606389494598
" for heaven's sake , madam , speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you to offend mr .	2.6944872942072022
on miss lucas's persevering , however , she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it must . "	3.4090663463380015
" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside , " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "	2.8750746156876796
after tea , mr . bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .	3.086591057855008
this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .	2.009744830127762
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	2.6688704186826455
how i laughed !	9.482595158727023
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .	3.4388134467132137
1.e .	108.27842135145501
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "	3.705719431351997
mr . bennet replied that he had not .	7.062304480879893
the other is miss de bourgh .	5.7633858686399835
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	2.599419013054223
" i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly .	3.729705436855176
she shook her head .	7.612832582084487
when mr . collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .	2.3692424932241076
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial .	3.870186126575237
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	4.898385734918729
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to----you shall try it some day.--do your sisters play and sing ? "	2.0608485975748376
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	2.35857852766836
" how should you have liked making sermons ? "	3.2761416772990652
i came to try you .	5.501514386784904

" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend.--"you dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "	2.6243131753541236
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	2.2867084700117783
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .	3.9165460160529415
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	3.682232113525702
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	2.7317041441397563
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	2.3243565529428527
" my dear mr . bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? "	2.696768734709193
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .	2.8038445094045907
" he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only . "	3.0791092037345162
" but does lydia know nothing of this ?	3.808569271102664
" money !	22.64910596379619
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks . "	2.656842672254743
i hope she will turn out well . "	3.406434572832284
you are lucky in having such a master . "	3.347982665035664
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	2.088454928917807
and so did mrs . forster .	6.596601830744452
she is grown so brown and coarse !	3.479838894472702
" i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	2.670072031318208
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	2.4766589331260707
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .	4.637924253738747
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs . bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	3.268608766624354
" to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "	2.4544895587488433
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	2.4428735747913093
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	3.0225651441084715
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	2.868580150390557
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	3.7829297031170634
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .	4.210582044108418
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week ; and even mr . darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .	2.6689247023725104
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she .	4.123084824200234
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	2.7811399975240967
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	3.4038872035882535
yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .	5.108879245862022
wickham is safe . "	7.082997013356564
" but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	3.4041845522647183
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	2.841708873713285
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr . collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .	2.309788673791851
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that mr . darcy could be so unworthy of mr . bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	2.324392391042056
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .	2.5905961956049857
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	2.510844161816585
" certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	2.775028830854937
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "	2.793406919521102
mr .	6.495854594468836
mr . darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	3.4319929625579504
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	2.6144807410731317
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	2.3838902177845886
what congratulations will then flow in !	4.538939830262175
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	2.340988632240129
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid .	2.579553966957298
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	2.6049593786863414
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .	2.9571747095816154
she was ashamed to think how much .	4.427317039767638
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	3.086968413692148
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "	2.3433203021493543
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ .	2.635986093345234
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	3.528847448037036
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .	2.9810848898270015
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs . long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr . morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "	2.4947333036183417
in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .	2.934252491587039
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "	3.159810455614671
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	3.582847512681734
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	2.914044900010923
" miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , " despises cards .	3.9561808575548936
all this was acknowledged to mrs . gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--"i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	2.568535850154246
" miss bennet , do you know who i am ?	4.268488303522664
but we are all liable to error .	4.2250797736598
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	3.5116123191129707
hang kitty !	24.41085000412845
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?	2.395893992573122
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	3.1622457120940757
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	2.9376083903519716
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs . jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	2.4261662725188935
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	2.5706597115195238
i .	90.16397002807777
when mrs . bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	2.763450546420364
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .	3.8484558932708217
mr . collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	3.4324607063161285
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "	3.024518131622548
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "	3.1176766724064717
" and i have another favour to ask .	4.228565142307259
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	2.480994355193553
but it is of small importance . "	4.835648205757655
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was .	3.3871011414714354
" aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs . long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "	3.2352380577572197
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . "	4.55050413675039
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "	3.468986491709739
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .	3.176441847511562
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah !	2.3254691874208313
" and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .	3.6650238164432865
" i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy ; " grieved--shocked .	3.7732683244261467
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "	2.5059468983825828
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	2.4502772349492585
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	3.4165495718307963
nobody wants him to come .	7.301357138375587
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company .	3.3553836526002856
" sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs . bennet , alarmed .	4.0614167115382624
you must come and make lizzy marry mr . collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ . "	2.861247695513154
mr . darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	3.8366079665029273
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	2.1675772140007075
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	2.2826746708126486
wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison.--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , i can only say that i am sorry.--the necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas's accidental information , that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	2.102119053116449
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	2.308060680210911
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can,--or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away . "	2.262285106181807
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	4.149277911447178
is she handsome ? "	7.059405382600438
professor michael s . hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .	2.321746303800464
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	3.02504323953314
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . collins was to attend them , at the request of mr . bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .	2.599535900048856
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh . "	2.706282721542729
" you did !	10.775122846258435
her own thoughts were employing her .	4.553732007834119
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "	2.4232374240065657
then addressing her daughter , " oh !	5.253999413769893
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr .	2.5842652590087343
" oh , lord !	4.756608298242942
she shall hear my opinion . "	4.731850557945651
" good gracious !	6.159512110684653
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .	2.6380107231320467
" my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	2.42923113176469
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	3.8876936709791106
" you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs . nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .	2.9035967200548853
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	2.5985534482540213
you refuse , then , to oblige me .	4.6207303069960215
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st . james's , with very decent composure .	2.1310108679204016
chapter i .	13.909159726663392
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require . "	2.961662438067851
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	3.695156437598558
" he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "	2.8568580391735874
" your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth .	3.1759293429997153
vol .	43.84228546262358
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william's too long .	3.9297795201954235
" i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man . "	2.7113194363292146
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	3.5531583358767302
she cried .	14.243573202858558
i will have no reserves from _you_ . "	3.5431743368359943
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	2.5365214877824047
oh !	19.31992947065936
_invented by m^{rs } bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._ _engraved for no .	2.394491500758177
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	3.705878698744579
what could your ladyship propose by it ? "	3.3048200184615717
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	2.6399523528407283
so imprudent a match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	2.6642988276443
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	2.3765000443152045
" yes , she will remain there till christmas . "	3.0729284552557057
" would mr . darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "	2.3494357803443306
" can you come to-morrow ? "	4.016269652328558
it is a pity they are not handsome !	4.515626131393638
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	2.717014011526043
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	2.476624134055038
chapter xiii .	11.504358223205136
" you may well warn me against such an evil .	2.7900341966708058
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	3.559032555102316
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	2.3340171010406676
their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	2.2545934510347627
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance .	4.851997075694394
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	2.5703722613043496
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	2.492504150150267
console lady catherine as well as you can .	6.7436694260858125
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	3.5003375314429643
" i should not mind any thing at all . "	2.9549251779786965
" i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	2.3553414175420513
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "	3.079514626668135
" but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr . bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "	2.9399421859167214
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	2.4073639284107915
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr . collins instead !	2.8426339120219133
she longed to see mrs . philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs . wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs . hill and the two housemaids .	2.690964679360989
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	2.8285204983101875
" good god !	9.68471039954678
" true .	14.533743533861344
" it is well .	7.624109861746286
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her . "	3.4333390388598506
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .	3.5512692542828685
one ought not to repine;--but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	4.1474025765764875
" that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter .	3.2823071624095013
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	2.9376954106045434
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	2.344929245355969
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	2.8979044115068224
" and do you really know all this ? "	2.9513926391976844
good girl !	22.348112840668865
" not at all . "	4.333220203755992
" you appear to me , mr . darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	3.319741350012216
" how good it was in you , my dear mr . bennet !	4.961041078446192
i expected you to stay two months .	4.105079967134521
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	2.6428386163313973
this accounted to elizabeth for mr . wickham's being among them .	4.045570885487992
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "	3.441765654609801
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . "	2.8859086855632903
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "	2.5073166838332224
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	2.686373893658067
mr . darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . bingley never stirs without him . "	2.223142201237346
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	2.3136773096820464
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .	2.5989947547671917
" but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "	2.653726279788945
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth .	4.145175126026199
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	3.185787895759121
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .	4.10976298997587
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "	2.255231757459416
she answered him with cold civility .	4.538838826753355
" his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	2.8730002118642406
why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	2.803418424984292
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest .	2.228441848178814
mrs . gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	2.571607620376271
mr . wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	2.1772278578360518
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	2.4235554511207296
said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	3.674086420054585
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	2.7081708186231586
chapter v . " i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	2.849747039109658
why was he to be the judge ? "	4.4927184305839125
this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	2.548871114575684
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	2.8452253813249406
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	2.7228622339754214
my dear mr . bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?	3.7341761890067837
" to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you . "	2.3334124235005462
has she any family ? "	5.414660810856808
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	2.44701096115867
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised , very much surprised,--so lately as mr . collins was wishing to marry you .	2.955654468387364
he now wished it more than ever .	4.284842752813163
he arranges the business just as he pleases . "	3.464032847748736
we were married , you know , at st . clement's , because wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	2.867256371032235
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	2.240651155586198
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs . philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	2.86337900105732
i hope we may often meet again . "	3.801831056584192
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	2.3636368806648838
elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	1.959035580089003
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "	2.2797457339043343
the discussion of mr . collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	2.737736016756949
mr . darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	2.7009818710816877
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "	3.9819655248661308
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs . bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	2.3008549041184945
the adieu is charity itself .	5.030952018341024
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .	3.305106568874251
mr . collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	3.089401148762544
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	3.155000336402499
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	2.7686108014098707
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .	2.1910626345972575
the moral will be perfectly fair .	4.704242731013651
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr .	2.704331558856502
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	3.392231002204888
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .	4.223405176414495
" neglect !	22.558549992699895
i guessed as much . "	5.531824888787509
" and what is fifty miles of good road ?	3.261820630016953
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	2.685018694833288
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs .	2.1108331380782284
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy .	2.0868530968589374
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	3.222665093697008
" this is a wretched beginning indeed !	3.6688404419705156
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ . "	3.193835980503247
it was a rational scheme to be sure !	4.424421188069519
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "	3.1974688415172494
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	3.4414612173384564
cried elizabeth .	10.329309900021203
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .	3.4460067232247646
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	2.6799655594197946
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr . darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your's .	2.7165329098057325
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	2.677067264858406
" is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )	2.422630138755686
but , really , i know not what to say .	4.322387501121306
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	4.580933321650629
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	2.9077070141849473
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	2.8778482539850776
" a thorough , determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	2.276716992856278
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	2.627605324708662
" you are quite right .	4.899866099496783
but mr . bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	2.238073405120262
" i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	2.8908837866626174
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	2.298539185899476
miss bingley i am sure cannot .	7.932663832984936
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg-tm works .	2.951494689096563
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	3.6283374596793174
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .	2.705624925541837
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	3.8066075625994875
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--here you are in your own family . "	2.3184668480074553
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	4.646447336767871
oh !	19.31992947065936
but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself . "	2.416507134475982
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	2.0910015786298954
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	2.722103547706123
how odious i should think them ! "	4.19939328114722
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	2.4599488988311218
exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good .	7.525701582149505
" oh !	4.947216533565322
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	2.9656404282271276
i must speak to hill , this moment . "	3.4170965018376536
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .	3.331481472502237
said she .	11.862111320090186
this was not very consoling to mrs . bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	3.8227901553153165
" i think she will .	5.97243156192924
" i do not think we were speaking at all .	3.277512789569861
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	2.7879707469588273
family pride , and _filial_ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	2.90977359031654
every thing that is charming !	6.6359299024692655
bingley.--but--good lord !	22.74143504324239
at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	2.799344405454183

--my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .	1.9384403347054928
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	2.411208452834228
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	2.8853712776757776

" it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "	2.9606340683270482
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	2.291035129370079
mrs . bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy . "	2.729205296546021
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	2.420344696875191

" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	3.0029291461714003
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	2.304193986750586

if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "	2.6131153851648987
very nonsensical to come at all !	5.1769399970217265
her answer was warmly in his favour .	4.480065147779382
" my style of writing is very different from yours . "	2.749058353982441
you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	2.789212862229181
though mr . bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	3.8250949768189177
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . "	2.2705380590035804
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	3.0179688468139023
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	3.2945894965934217
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .	3.414205963276602
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away .	2.4292237663213005
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .	2.055450859917382
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	2.4660329226281577
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	3.2271402563759675
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .	3.5771960896512667
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	2.529475836751464
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	5.098031969679193
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	3.113455663341857
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	2.4307186758032135
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	2.905248367694275
" indeed i do not dare . "	5.64197368792917
" that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth .	3.3385944631380493
[ illustration : morning dress .	4.7606060298027995
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	2.04697447458752
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	2.478916486575104
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .	2.2601529990818086
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	2.803103735217483
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "	3.336616089595339
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .	2.3646602988019505
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	2.4434660895821523
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's . "	2.4571073381083153

they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	2.340408217876399
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	2.6877775166388798
" you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	2.839121543755161
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .	3.237140978959818
this mrs . younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	3.1349869805995247
heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ?	4.850519768619569
_i_ did for you .	7.280210657903574
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr . and mrs . gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	3.4230919897665766
" your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "	2.9903045152054295
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3 ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service .	1.840967107475448
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	2.9303309157562576
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs . gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .	2.8674911246021604
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	2.317577799531727
" miss bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be .	3.3204462230838843
mrs . gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	2.888508676651908
mrs . long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .	3.292464758770186
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "	2.328131091328171
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane .	2.797717931368392
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr . darcy !	4.412254696439283
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .	2.699678618973786
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	1.7969202835109295
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	2.7429197746665666
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . "	2.8444295824597616
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child .	2.717291247262543
" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .	2.955326685976693
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	2.6294215290178413
" you are a good girl ; " he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	3.3627571430970375
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .	2.691569515856921
she dared not even mention that gentleman .	4.143021173543364
he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	2.856974047255189
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "	2.5260409360134064
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	2.446834346667406
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .	2.184851200823482
this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	2.765180889720174
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	3.0667159888485043
" we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "	3.2790071074295732
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr . collins in time . "	3.1160086145254033
who would have thought it !	5.327062841420494
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both---- " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane ; " they are married ! "	2.9620678600241224
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	2.711010362429082
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	2.351145281465832
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	2.819939239009858
" i am sick of mr . bingley , " cried his wife .	4.763664223993139
oh !	19.31992947065936
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "	2.155497334509361
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	1.9486450438735023
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	2.983389160697204
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	2.4950023108156287
" upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .	2.365452539145691
but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	4.103117684738186
" which do you mean ? "	4.917138390465666
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . darcy .	2.5374228111423127
mrs . bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	2.8946631460927845
said she .	11.862111320090186
when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	2.601578656674401
at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . hurst and elizabeth herself .	3.035660352735482
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	2.385389389754346
chapter iii .	11.500047627214586
how he must have felt it ! "	4.761257701572591
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	3.606432066645386
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	2.406153583040021
i don't know .	10.934059852150316
" yours , &c . " as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	2.10431995301919
and it was not wholly without foundation .	6.19959806525757
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	2.773601169515431
" indeed , mr . collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	3.2797424666100037
you never see a fault in any body .	3.8839128375190017
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	2.599396828592502
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	2.230913410496494
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes . "	2.592894284576607
" fitzwilliam darcy . "	7.127429055707529
what did colonel forster say ?	6.1368215289574435
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane's . "	2.944459529558179
the party did not supply much conversation .	3.884523264075653
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "	2.3207035582243334
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	2.631650158037375
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	2.7732957286006363
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .	2.6112187840544743
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go--and , at another word , might stay a month . "	2.2821505581337256
mrs . collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	2.7564630594107715
there was another reason too for her opposition .	3.533614630908126
mrs . gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	2.2383495766322894
mr . collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	2.7665672381270427
mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	2.644834490313356
where , where is my uncle ? "	4.318603217113928
mr . collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	2.3346775095433143
but the case is this .	5.819138092178043
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .	2.7219686201735964
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment , now quartered in the north .	2.439396080725751
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	2.6272179758396295
when this was done , she had a less active part to play .	3.632581960346585
" _you_ observed it , mr . darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition . "	2.87267244184932
chapter viii .	11.504358223205136
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . "	2.5965062934111653
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	2.381733470628928
a few days after this visit , mr . bingley called again , and alone .	4.606883096163748
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !	2.709562442017545
" care of him!--yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	2.4797166506697215
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's . "	3.0057507517548063
jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "	3.5536770479556985
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	2.6686509365108373
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	2.926493718040339
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .	2.7921147798928687
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .	2.681108084699835
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "	2.917052095898236
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	2.3192320556773836
and his sisters are charming women .	5.468156967259366
" beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	2.971230056808466
" because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "	2.7591468290454344
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	2.5782050023805425
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	3.0251202256513294
mr . darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	2.78319866993825
chapter xiv .	13.68867928861669
" with my mother up stairs .	4.551098954545622
mrs . bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! "	2.97802553937829
but georgiana would not join her .	4.62921027737868
again she read on .	8.378312392151495
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	2.0599447002612745
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	2.5971662086347105
not all that mrs . bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr . bingley .	3.2940445829883185
mrs . collins knew not what to make of him .	3.9243337690910103
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	2.5306047584791793
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .	2.330002333288205
" yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "	2.6893185506621005
he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "	2.6474234713626315
it is nearly fifty miles . "	4.178111139375796
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "	2.8022417027848454
that he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	4.419863536607108
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	2.4207013573208442
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	2.138886567393595
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	3.1253785206231797
" one of them does . "	6.291922468505457
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr . collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	1.9277350649612872
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn .	2.4575571352663097
she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	2.496950558892137
" perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	3.331157224362554
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	2.830575127075701
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .	2.7878620464428674
and when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	2.7269404865985587
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	3.4730210952976592
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . darcy .	2.3300685497731046
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	2.7590700718540724
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	2.3676931538508024
lady catherine , sir william , and mr . and mrs . collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . jenkinson to make up her party .	3.0396560183708687
i will not tell you what it is .	4.494066939279212
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	2.4868675651567234
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	2.235627495714319
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	3.647165848069664
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	3.548512761105739
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	2.559813386790508
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? "	3.117372500024636
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	3.9112004359670958
those who do not complain are never pitied . "	3.3474993693645447
" i am sure there is not on _his_ .	4.3254352998925665
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr . darcy .	4.453350297886755
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton ?	2.536141812448558
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	2.311080436277208
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "	3.2080513245932845
i am so pleased--so happy .	5.030292570336904
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "	2.390676329091946
her figure was elegant , and she walked well;--but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	2.9259396144802574
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .	3.135325109328737
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself .	2.5645597438714334
" good heavens ! "	6.166479472265901
" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he .	3.212345620552424
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "	3.5965846636817624
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	3.2322913171929306
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	3.65333926730114
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	2.141708083017284
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	2.4214172940320564
amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	2.5574175520455227
darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "	3.2828289027019255
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	3.6651388301795467
" so much the better .	4.055475170968739
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	3.5010988175779287
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james's .	2.209645041107678
why should they try to influence him ?	4.04045938417027
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "	2.6674041451921093
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	2.7373647378506054
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr . bingley and netherfield .	2.5932935979949137
you will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you . "	3.222397932446776
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .	2.999331717075023
" no , no .	7.005820574407668
she went on .	14.171430589023545
what felicity !	21.45007840158506
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever . "	2.1966387689509403
darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "	2.5971400636918265
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	2.9905508921351727
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this discovery!--yet , how just a humiliation!--had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .	2.1965396879058554
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .	3.1907927370555855
mrs . gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	2.205331053090593
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr . wickham's attentions .	3.0169406321355865
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	3.8565710713492587
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me.--it is done , however , and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	2.275881516510853
cried elizabeth .	10.329309900021203
such very superior dancing is not often seen .	3.9012817254070336
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	4.633129297778596
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	2.328928405852361
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	2.7326297046241863
there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say . "	2.9201246300619568
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	1.8372319273210636
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	2.4376190373198625
you tear them to pieces . "	4.597749264119391
" it is _not_ mr . bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life . "	3.128026196721442
they repulsed every attempt of mrs . bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . collins , who was complimenting mr . bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	2.7017153656872512
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	2.300364827543562
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	2.350288171071919
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .	2.272344004887339
she would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house . "	3.874134483495571
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	3.1311100972808723
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .	3.014816037958391
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine . "	2.304539105412968
oh !	19.31992947065936
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	4.017753763207029
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? "	2.872805891572732
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	2.361471399966599
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	2.7073171960196922
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name .	3.024090823930412
" perhaps that is not possible for any one .	4.110349333621639
" are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "	3.0975213398236923
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	3.010185051724119
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	2.235609478539925
elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	3.848381158403346
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs . bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	3.171311969704468
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard.--but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	2.3079884885233652
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . darcy , she was directly retreating .	2.5407414390834555
" i will make no promise of the kind . "	2.9844749373193027
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	3.009346259889595
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	3.7709896716916793
" did you go by the village of kympton ? "	2.9720613750200497
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c . are sufficiently known .	2.1807647091734297
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy !	2.6251015370127844
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	2.5614570321075445
as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	2.9745650481127055
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "	2.4086888187724673
" how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	2.952191193840583
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce .	3.1256612526017813
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	2.1744302100372135
but does not jane correspond with the sister ?	3.6763839210964404
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	3.3106276999691797
allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	2.9305402009325
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	2.1291978379325305
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	2.692258291855287
had colonel forster seen denny himself ? "	3.7356234369690045
" oh !	4.947216533565322
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr . darcy , she could not but allow that mr . bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	2.2380300277875707
" i am , " said he , with a firm voice .	4.823851107449757
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "	3.0524767024298427
" now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr . bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	3.4924334073589347
" how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say.--_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "	2.52094178285097
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky . "	3.3632592479970627
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	2.7098362539423917
* * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	2.0401231085164895
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	2.274657245611599
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	3.9036835808565042
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr . and mrs . gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	3.0419981353520904
lady catherine seemed resigned .	6.5623410484539
" i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .	3.7184927081258667
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	2.2445841348472753
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	2.4723786623963573
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	4.284625808074282
and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?	2.638824905998805
i could hardly keep my countenance .	4.671006149511893
but it was not to be .	6.9632725343906
" no , indeed .	6.15257342857253
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . "	2.0824978213236798
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	2.1689532516096284
" indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	3.565383777258683
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .	2.393587298472817
mrs . reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	2.2893633752177927
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name .	3.2512560429935045
" we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth .	2.663297742420821
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	3.221643283712667
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	2.1942507427223616
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	2.159841234834269
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	3.2606310439970234
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .	3.5146492765940045
the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	3.062119124300944
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	2.532580521656472
to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	2.657890275217418
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	2.4812708743305105
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	2.1882080894492417
he danced only four dances !	4.642490510922782
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "	2.434197072119466
she had obtained private intelligence that mr . darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	2.911533891424087
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	2.555006065019292
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	2.944337825932257
vol .	43.84228546262358
do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "	3.2560414105306137
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . "	3.044365856881542
" we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire . "	3.3166875692351283
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . bennet and the children .	3.6434060786669784
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "	2.6814215695413957
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	2.461627189279237
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	3.876788682696501
he should be particularly happy at any time , &c . &c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	2.5129916857353676
all was joy and kindness .	5.358117875573419
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	3.031235948878867
the general prejudice against mr . darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	2.797118980025143
" but so we all do .	4.722217106915617
" you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion .	2.4286036207544397
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "	3.036047961399464
" _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness !	3.487667645259537
teazing , teazing , man !	6.061247205203557
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie . "	2.896787370156767
" perhaps we might be deceived . "	4.011448764424974
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	3.3145036002692057
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	3.2029537243078443
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .	2.9267472023923236
" you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "	2.873925728206421
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . bingley from your sister,--and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr .	2.27334758370585
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings .	2.5562482257881354
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	2.4448833051515115
the visit was returned in due form .	4.451014513973535
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	3.2986081740421533
indeed he has no improper pride .	4.809976120502845
" indeed you are mistaken .	6.063011686834509
a thousand things may arise in six months ! "	3.108071884983036
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	3.1363502177778235
they were hopeless of remedy .	5.088955308918251
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her.'	3.50201335564356
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings . "	2.2684468890245464
" but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	2.555878719359786
how much you must have gone through ! "	4.630957506862567
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	2.9403285773992476
--a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . hurst began again .	3.8370528146011593
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs . gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	2.7910231906588017
that he has neither integrity nor honour .	4.827044931166492
but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	2.724785894776318
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	3.3507299946787437
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	2.325271494623278
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing . "	2.149493968857141
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	2.4242081792801278
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ . "	3.0286400076791034
mr . darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life !	2.5158665257334643
" i wish it may . "	4.480675254215387
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	4.657597672381312
every body is disgusted with his pride .	4.2567008610279
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	2.998594438366204
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr . bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged .	2.724229372230814
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park , when he put his letter into her hand !	2.3438084037409044
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	2.0215134076383245
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . "	2.592646828463848
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation ( and you ! )	2.079691565444038
did you see it ? "	5.181799220108179
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	2.3533937515915304
but i am at his disposal .	4.7315192799697945
my dear brother , " replied mrs . bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for .	3.7239969573942457
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , " i am not . "	3.3171060660383986
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	3.667852929703538
can it be really so !	6.965598073483708
" but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "	2.562921863707094
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	3.4106509577603688
" why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "	2.852253611317133
1.e.4 .	104.36077079776408
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	3.4191493610956134
mrs . bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	2.578482149564777
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence . "	3.1852555654706136
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	2.7629304613778642
" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life---- " mrs . philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	2.5721637262678265
mrs . bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	2.1432763186342187
darcy.--_i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "	2.710194238104192
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? "	3.0591614758496544
i did not expect such a compliment . "	4.367839214626113
since her father's death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "	2.589924071185715
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr . bennet , " and nothing can clear mr . collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .	3.1044940205885303
who attended to you ?	8.238916783616846
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	2.306506372155262
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . gardiner's long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .	2.364915762484459
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	2.6833289899172112
" oh !	4.947216533565322
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	2.8090929219501786
" and quite alone ?	6.883330436861049
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	2.9900454500475964
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	2.5898924468096105
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it .	2.591047487387114
mrs . bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_ .	2.589779333784502
" you are mistaken .	6.259716151622999
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	3.0830225509237748
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	2.591723968442103
" that is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	3.1885604924909456
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	2.2072710494469234
" but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? "	2.5721283219678983
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	3.164086889080574
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	2.5282000741316204
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	2.5408811904409094
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	3.087265605653481
" i am trying to make it out . "	3.403497304933627
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	2.1979896586614425
pemberley was now georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .	3.186692327894811
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she .	3.910343197584875
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	2.72261859765895
you may have drawn him in . "	4.062130633610789
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? "	3.0482174017776047
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	5.855098452467097
" it must not be thought of .	4.873479801826811
" how can you talk so ? "	3.3889331974999486
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	2.3070258458307795
and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "	2.422594971847477
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . darcy were by no means over .	2.4932925243744277
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came , and mrs . bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	2.5951457686432597
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	2.9128435724799493
here comes hill .	10.375184679252259
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	2.7307841454671737
not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . bennet give up the point .	4.146661428926269
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	2.172795571568528
" of what are you talking ? "	4.273684569120474
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	2.4690151467386774
the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	2.275904780301579
collins must excuse me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	3.2873688995825177
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	2.4363839342385627
" he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	3.357046279458798
" your's sincerely , &c . " miss bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	2.8574184441897263
but let me advise you to think better of it .	3.628469084540862
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	2.571573618646689
" she looks sickly and cross.--yes , she will do for him very well .	2.952566198318055
i will only add , god bless you .	3.3685465887846915
sir william had been delighted with him .	3.910795904375714
imprudent as a marriage between mr . wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .	2.4102644973064344
" nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley .	4.666475651443793
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	2.2484576315012856
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	3.5438611245030867
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . "	2.5597513256304834
but these things happen so often !	4.433060016214264
" if your master would marry , you might see more of him . "	2.7656224677446613
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal . "	4.178276311792572
on the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	2.239346732217485
mrs . gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	2.7841578404203506
" and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?	3.3856821775914674
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library . "	2.8114068009442077
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "	2.444427227107773
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . "	2.9035837245643723
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	2.0394829913072114
his reception however was of the most flattering kind .	3.9546528914430055
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	3.8331418238507426
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	2.2459268125002145
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .	2.937358793544213
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .	3.041975034913594
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	3.152839817022099
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . "	2.358986081451915
their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	2.6897729678070434
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	2.083653378192847
one day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	3.191737080143763
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	3.314998332340342
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .	2.5994169934433597
he owns it himself without disguise . "	3.7528082447162703
" yes , " thought elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	2.9533994509049024
robinson . "	23.818923042926638
chapter xix .	11.504358223205136
" and they are really to be married ! "	4.063045059463021
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "	4.173752851226402
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	2.7535503904025975
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room .	2.8762315410976735
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness.--mr .	2.840345831953961
mr . collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	2.895256534913559
but now it comes out . "	3.82669934090995
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	3.102922962317573
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .	2.5388325234855724
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	2.113364120030873
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr . collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr . bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2.405629510825472
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	2.273483792898704
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .	2.307778585955547
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	2.6771999098794894
72 of la belle assemblee 1^{st } july 1815_ ] pride & prejudice .	2.2151579133947887
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	4.978055978932505
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	2.9723183997802
such a disappointment !	9.82958210250475
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	2.8504567240520475
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	2.8564103033408252
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	3.2390420445260473
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	3.1791702456438586
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	2.2080352565039765
chapter ix .	13.68867928861669
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	3.1871319020273217
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! "	5.061735444641476
" it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley .	4.030315247097565
mrs . bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	2.1882030896540043
said elizabeth .	11.538449393955492
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	2.377074070886976
then taking the disengaged arm of mr . darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .	3.083941686586636
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	2.470561309099785
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "	3.358375984028434
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	2.205344287983602
mr . darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ .	3.8027738896771823
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .	2.8554340849594553
dear me !	14.260820423973183
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "	2.656581950356184
elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both .	5.325230581301157
" with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "	2.600167426167089
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	2.647172355061728
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	2.527199127909992
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	3.116700395175062
" you are severe on us . "	3.6981176823562074
mr . gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	2.26891034917205
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	2.1560027490573117
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "	2.9567305472632275
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .	2.578064987585067
he has also _brotherly_ pride , which with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "	2.2025155301387573
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	3.096500344463918
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2.5659908046768454
" how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	3.1017135156055984
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	2.472085392721937
repeated mr . bennet .	13.305289605341704
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded .	3.009308618618915
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "	2.8985808968895808
" she is a most charming young lady indeed .	3.8776337136789905
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "	2.302619831212008
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well . "	2.932617000171693
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	2.437710765060671
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day . "	2.6186556489874797
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?	2.553205801584004
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	3.495817164914176
mr . darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	2.4556929141363493
what a contrast between him and his friend !	4.121016774206855
" an easy distance do you call it ?	3.8127647784436896
never , since reading jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her .	2.6274890743615855
his revenge would have been complete indeed .	5.625949632710702
" i think you said she was a widow , sir ?	3.4884020129903273
" what is it you mean ? "	3.885031294724417
mr . wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	2.606686992359602
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .	3.083286232392123
" la ! "	6.511729348367483
does he know his real character ? "	4.536736927911921
this will never do . "	5.561110422626526
" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried .	3.7510104127140838
when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	2.95898347085204
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .	4.63312154172607
" my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "	3.4995612069917854
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .	3.4651679850516652
no . "	19.603272784169626
" it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "	2.4035298403910845
no , no , this is not likely .	5.162528953714447
" oh !	4.947216533565322
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . "	3.677177938560519
but it is all , all too late now . "	3.7711955954041914
" as often as i can .	5.566234877145831
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	3.056977572009024
cried mrs . gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	3.048262440806819
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs .	2.8988170859760944
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	2.3343303594914593
" i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	2.744046113014223
do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "	3.041395109921191
how can it affect them ? "	4.146376816122998
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "	2.435376210369348
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	2.0924336694762506
" i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs . bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .	3.4476122105014864
chapter xix .	11.504358223205136
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between mr . bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	2.3518126402439115
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	2.4680966986737487
" did charlotte dine with you ? "	3.7542039816458366
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	2.912095800486599
he has children of his own , and may have more .	4.598414240722532
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .	2.8413294780750773
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	3.4337140456867505
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	5.394608379827649
mr . hurst and mr . bingley were at piquet , and mrs . hurst was observing their game .	3.9248745153172724
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long .	2.54899671660438
" i am not likely to leave kent for some time .	3.835702416327269
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	3.3986892228166012
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can.--daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	2.2547786129664362
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	2.23304176052101
as she pronounced these words , mr . darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	2.7731747462139147
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	2.5058095813214827
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	3.2966259014164154
" i have said no such thing .	4.022642996226686
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart .	2.319431550434875
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .	3.1460157019767165
" i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	2.9935193382913416
you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage .	2.031067681504931
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	2.373897314684688
one must speak a little , you know .	5.043438816034798
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	2.530791659287004
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	4.094810459287191
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .	2.3922069737181575
" and what arts did he use to separate them ? "	2.671869830904854
mr . and mrs . gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy.--though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr . and mrs . gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	2.1228323578478734
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	2.577522748799114
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "	2.9811206395281826
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them .	2.427418416431114
for god's sake , say no more of his partners .	3.801406623435258
but i think mr . darcy improves on acquaintance . "	4.8165385283920195
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . stone .	2.6747514028781416
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "	3.4122527134453495
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	3.1012159294181
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .	2.8873478701213595
my sweetest lizzy !	10.491594407473197
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	3.1490675196130935
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	3.9207996605271513
i thought i should have broke my heart . "	3.356582485964313
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	2.3820965619396968
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	3.1880740143940134
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . "	2.861915357815552
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	2.204546439901959
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "	2.8292521262614763
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	2.700584982537846
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "	2.6585510179190432
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where .	2.988571554246088
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure .	2.9703024001783738
you will be a very happy woman . "	4.678603818164599
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear . "	2.6440450152057906
" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "	2.355561518928655
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "	2.507033542545341
" that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly . "	2.9574275491073783
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane .	2.931926865547498
thank god !	21.179098094588802
london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	1.9636304204514694
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	3.1638689983965462
i am ashamed of you !	5.6386669560835125
" he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling .	4.3524794123707276
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . wickham and the officers , mr . collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	2.4890562571018466
he was full of joy and attention .	3.848188454753863
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	4.105479333263482
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard . "	2.879179036681851
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	2.7278901608628723
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	2.580851400998531
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "	2.5897995493902797
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .	3.723786417649146
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	2.2548023671407464
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	2.978118259210186
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . "	2.4489313784062112
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "	3.02418914954883
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq .	3.138992113524922
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	2.3615642356049174
" wickham so very bad !	5.501167725443383
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	2.1532977522792183
she smiled , but made no answer .	4.084318555820603
you know i have .	6.974057789738997
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	1.9972011699052925
such a charming man!--so handsome !	5.654199681490861
" i do not believe a word of it , my dear .	4.1100632208117
their visits to mrs . philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	3.615161130448125
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	2.6618185658182907
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	2.741613299583028
" you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged .	2.7088917728448707
" and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? "	2.9397419709066805
she had very little notice from any but him .	3.3156144375410928
if elizabeth , when mr . darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	3.3547628370214952
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	2.4856780185255065
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "	2.190259901825842
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	3.2243218945299414
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	3.4471446218179578

well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	2.676803601053881
did you see him while you were at lambton ?	3.4596242220710094
all loveliness and goodness as she is !	4.391731552249504
it is admirable ! "	6.332543966296327
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	4.750002045427315
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .	2.235789461020836
ii .	99.37775629993263
elizabeth silently attended her .	7.625463837847043
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	2.3660173734239724
his surprise was great .	7.377434678256232
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	3.7252918416520706
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	2.4544617279179533
he was on one side of her mother .	4.720349109337556
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .	2.8391570133946624
mrs . hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	2.4771629369048314
" speak to lizzy about it yourself .	4.138327417664505
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	2.35770602013292
sir william did not say much .	5.484215416893699
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "	2.621392180734014
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	2.9817853048679592
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	3.1223971072203387
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	2.291422858045296
wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "	3.32871123611865
_we_ were always good friends ; and now we are better . "	3.287507306082991
if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .	3.6231817871923715
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	2.109275972904519
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .	2.619274712659238
" she is my youngest girl but one .	3.5572598408446114
he cannot afford it .	6.712971624549957
" from the former .	6.953927333676006
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	2.4367030511372327
it was then disclosed in the following manner .	4.0881927325978635
" laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	3.3982004368424117
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .	3.0577277988934006
_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . philips , appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr . darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .	2.401617521826576
" nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth .	4.009278447027469
mrs . bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	2.5012524132192193
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	2.7180017200356055
" you mistake me , my dear .	5.047794641248407
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "	3.5107207924727075
good or bad ? "	7.573807572707417
on this subject , what can you have to say ?	4.139916700501294
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	3.4008682621527653
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	3.1749953668557924
said he , as he joined her .	6.996240007273081
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say , three very silly sisters .	2.5343783052795974
" if i , " said mr . collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	2.243385930346985
" these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .	2.787561136738968
" if i were as rich as mr . darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was .	3.2271842873353758
she declared her resolution .	7.956339862279948
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "	3.261099307646134
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	2.185288223630209
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr . wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .	2.3933116940119303
" mr . darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_ . "	2.582904107031956
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	2.2768392396931514
come be quick , be quick !	4.968918967563391
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely .	2.6492724757692
on being made acquainted with the present mr . darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr . fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	2.4494711318888402
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	2.9790368270568
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .	2.2907497940915165
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home .	2.5342854855137538
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	2.696396709479626
a small sum could not do all this . "	3.3317523676139214
cried miss bingley .	9.892080947290765
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	3.0055563150020914
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne's .	2.9072956744182434
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	2.342162436915455
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .	2.51361213910298
" did mr . darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "	3.7369402122605226
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	2.427002446183236
" let us sit down .	5.707378542373892
but think no more of the letter .	6.226497334450302
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	2.1299177482944467
lydia , my love , ring the bell .	3.696944565543795
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months .	2.911555556701563
" mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them .	2.976063187327531
darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	2.5496381134437263
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable .	3.330191287890987
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	2.9581916667464014
" what do you think ?	5.447610343019556
it is because he will not give himself the trouble . "	3.193794070610282
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm collection .	1.995846367533168
it only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling . "	2.625628278724124
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	2.6444015360030058
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .	2.919151033379111
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	2.5754865381809244
but , lizzy !	9.052198607361266
they were ignorant , idle , and vain .	3.5090222934147026
* * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . bennet's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	2.581614434501851
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	4.065016799254437
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	2.9203998620697016
mrs . gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .	2.485204765593195
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball--and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	2.828387371934297
he had to be sure done much .	6.13690391819181
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	3.5082816990464543
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . darcy .	2.522041453386942
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	5.414004705528045
they found mr . bennet still up .	6.500902027361288
" insolent girl ! "	6.811143921875684
make haste , and come down this moment . "	3.5653944300837566
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "	3.6760100067180854
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .	2.8508009151951845
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . "	2.7212696934196265
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	3.0330641111515924
you see how continually we are engaged there .	3.911860863164804
" at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "	2.9466813204871056
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .	2.9618874851105135
" oh !	4.947216533565322
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .	4.209128161889341
one morning , about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	2.38231045178543
my uncle ! "	10.722398813987226
they were , therefore , to go.--elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	3.1190116580439176
does your charge give you much trouble ?	4.268510072599725
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "	2.836761615894184
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	2.233349642045037
i always had a value for him .	3.954325684144677
she finds miss pope a treasure .	4.140551470124546
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation .	2.7670340431489886
" very , very much .	6.64887704236866
" and have you answered the letter ? "	3.296240846015899
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	2.5881891261051106
" that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	3.847739481120843
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	3.2669745546774482
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	3.92233083586211
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr . darcy had been staying there .	2.64897757294747
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	2.5340037293902986

if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	2.6895263241322374
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .	3.410256592649102
elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	3.0900387098269317
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "	2.4303785244704263
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite . "	3.2651582843337263
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?	3.5039297498532216
" oh !	4.947216533565322
have you never happened to see her there ? "	4.280029536722789
i knew you would be wishing me joy . "	3.433845839822308
mrs . bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr . collins began .	3.64813261790052
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	4.185227590623079
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	2.642980208380381
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	3.1997275454958163
you supposed more than really existed .	4.630694027013207
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs . hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am ! "	2.261507701752662
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	2.3191107917438716
elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal . "	4.45798538043552
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?	3.864335800959651
mr . darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	3.5076701131304993
she repeated .	21.829546064341592
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	2.269842612517709
she says lizzy had better have taken mr . collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it .	3.0249330103458143
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr . bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .	2.547185765887007
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .	2.567108237368206
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? "	3.0470211498460724
" but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure .	2.979976646754612
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	2.4724502692958517
" but upon my honour i do _not_ .	4.397141687203588
" but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "	2.519597128802436
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	3.0783287352123643
during their walk , it was resolved that mr . bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	3.465711117943201
can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "	4.304045797072014
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "	3.311677903603275
" no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	3.9440023748081567
their reception at home was most kind .	3.983108975670277
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you !	3.536507377144201
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	3.4387927088890935
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . "	3.0350540977884934
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "	2.7545301073709973
i knew how it would be .	7.433303078383188
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	2.1073781076579423
my dear , dear lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet ! "	2.9266917892758144
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	2.2042767893758817
_that_ abominable mr .	10.247023085203056
chapter iii .	11.500047627214586
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	2.2708910285320827
" write to me very often , my dear . "	4.287418521407732
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	2.1864286983697427
" a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	2.238513224136097
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr . darcy about it , if you had rather not .	3.527842481972564
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon .	2.8725747765625425
it was mr . collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	2.671920813704199
that tall , proud man . "	4.285291641641226
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	2.652532205548098
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king .	3.270201026645562
my dear charlotte,--impossible ! "	6.080914588974387
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	2.71384299550496
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence .	2.7755698894048475
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .	3.0399087147906987
but i knew i should persuade you at last .	3.4721231948489617
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .	3.7909877173283513
" yes , all of them , i think .	5.565716735562582
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	2.9613825176800908
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	4.880126627176927
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .	4.178049591169865
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	3.071219406420588
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	2.195681845077586
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	2.838085619578409
in three volumes .	6.354806282472118
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	2.571478334055698
my feelings in every respect forbid it .	4.6849859945619
" he brought it with him for us to see . "	3.391775480738501
" his misfortunes ! "	6.5770046206546295
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	2.2648379620973107
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	2.3412814766365324
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling .	2.2993502612456407
mrs . hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	2.7431472439853484
" do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "	3.8528156602586265
" _that_ you certainly shall . "	4.472844594451192
mr . darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	3.0927388632334964
but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	2.31859365747335
i will put on my things in a moment .	3.3994255719536683
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ?	4.07074515477228
chapter xxii .	20.50194744890955
darcy ? "	11.617565663992835
" i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "	2.309043926172066
" i can much more easily believe mr . bingley's being imposed on , than that mr . wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it be not so , let mr . darcy contradict it .	2.4044394676566037
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr . wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	2.790551187360507
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	2.3688290619131225
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	3.046378965116829
" i have already told her so once , by your desire . "	2.661850529603402
mr . collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	2.0402193675906304
mr . collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	2.2147259921019744
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr . collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr . collins and me have a little conversation together . "	2.8731742210170768
but he is an ugly fellow !	4.741396578255241
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	3.0280923336272743
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	2.0817300768234985
jane was distressed .	9.161787250415047
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .	1.907153901066414
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	3.002978885742762
no , never .	10.576977126480877
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	2.7337170853943786
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution . "	2.6382300273182
" are they indeed ? "	5.165331874098422
" you have insulted me , in every possible method .	3.696912972141496
i told mrs . collins so before you came .	5.075852582899602
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	2.267166939396245
" perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth .	3.4062461600378593
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one .	2.4174594951449877
" do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa , you will not mind my waking mr .	3.069437843421073
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	2.8765756082885403
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	2.598812557413321
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	3.1479565608334443
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	2.557112782524782
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	2.876263151713156

london : printed for t . egerton , military library , whitehall .	1.9636304204514694
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "	2.5674254814223927
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .	2.402174893668712
perhaps he thought her too young .	4.794174132796292
his sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	1.9375749275003942
chapter x .	11.504358223205136
it was really a very handsome thought .	5.241348950934674
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	2.7370449799368535
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "	2.435959405231472
you take delight in vexing me .	4.480554846175259
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first , i should be completely in your way;--and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire . "	1.9693100839149655
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .	3.3011312499921273

cried jane .	22.54562645542036
so genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "	1.8443014773656519
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	3.15493062949198
" mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them .	5.0579007608222195
darcy ? "	11.617565663992835
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! "	4.412105049071151
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	2.7455337072735295
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	2.75914014968096
" an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .	3.4095105738412084
_i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "	2.585735885431163
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . "	2.657632871905691
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "	2.1720160813318947
unfeeling , selfish girl !	7.687014740734816
" i am sure i shall break _mine_ , " said lydia .	3.9707526473477723
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . darcy .	2.9131554482739017
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ .	2.9253598431123846
are the others coming out ? "	4.759614711580609
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	3.2873377943331077
mr . collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs . bennet .	3.6474370786957944
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	2.6682451949065085
arguments are too much like disputes .	5.59409597329611
" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "	2.7515734391418296
but mrs . bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	2.450614578648006
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "	3.025983129181725
consider how important every moment is , in such a case . "	3.853450963543329
" yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	3.323411142688695
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	2.6356813883385284
i know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	2.924205571670405
" i never can be thankful , mr . bennet , for any thing about the entail .	3.4713048036905176
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	3.795316573551576
* * * * * " good gracious ! "	3.0983408334406177
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	2.2055592950192
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr . collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs .	2.5841903165028945
he cannot know what mr . darcy is . "	5.145834684794173
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	2.138185273936495
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "	2.984250732962366
" oh !	4.947216533565322
is it true ? "	7.184815199560516
[ illustration : a vicarage house . ]	3.6103777683427833
" but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	2.301157613895372
you must contrive to send somebody .	4.354248920298508
little more than half a day's journey .	5.02702319290925
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	4.067265539608083
" pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe .	2.7762020525479114
but i must write no more .	4.803316712936447
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	2.1836803115995242
so much the man of fashion !	5.508757106491363
1.e.7 .	109.68598581262755
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! "	3.1291878265605324
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	2.403221931115208
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	2.727634163127529
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "	3.1532996863469704
and she rose as she spoke .	5.678866303309098
" i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women .	2.657512401291017
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	2.78237637274419
" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	3.582240408188691
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .	2.3761767472062405
one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	1.8300900213588358
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	3.1326948384200466
we want none of them ; do we ? "	3.7917071394397874
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "	2.6962616438702445
" it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	2.691283199819506
1.d .	104.36077079776408
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	2.1536807085685328
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	2.1310405368012475
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	2.856722395479029
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "	2.2726002908630467
" what is mr . darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?	4.526647996962558
" i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . "	2.622118099797104
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "	3.3615167156003714
" it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease .	2.377066718027639
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over-ruled , as i always am .	3.309742241767294
we _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen .	2.9007638736811296
nobody can tell what i suffer!--but it is always so .	3.3199925127116434
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	2.3267035305402146
how he lived i know not .	5.803724110888312
" there can be no doubt of that .	4.659478279137651
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs . philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	2.1500481500193267
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	3.13298633847121
" this is wholly unexpected .	5.114637564278347
the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	2.3754030837555957
the first week of their return was soon gone .	3.28845361201397
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	2.199243397302643
but however insincere _you_ may choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so .	3.013308905662703

those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs . forster called her , and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	2.452804313711388
" another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you . "	3.7140815237605143
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	3.06831404361407
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	4.695899685920621
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "	2.382672363243478
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .	3.193800461336155
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	3.4740106991925614
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr . bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? "	3.0133193780730845
what shall we do with him ?	5.18999159694674
" oh !	4.947216533565322
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet .	3.7311690843429437
" i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .	2.528582862009258
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written . "	3.7399210344073723
i am very , very sorry .	5.259759315264017
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	3.230410324668547
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	2.4856395158489013
darcy ! "	11.6126425396636
" i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him . "	3.0536746818621827
" oh !	4.947216533565322
mrs . hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	2.4651860841726263
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	2.4602547781784163
" what is there of good to be expected ? "	3.3611082574660274
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	3.583746155482419
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	2.7628863203186826
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs . bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "	2.062419845980675
it adds even another motive .	5.404510640748246
is this to be endured !	6.369240164005978
" whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ . "	3.0982908711831736
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it .	2.8866704554919442
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	2.782836097545658
" will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at present i have not room to do them justice . "	2.455549020602295
" a man who had felt less , might . "	3.2428354990327883
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	2.2060892041399196
they must all go to brighton .	4.9659970579372965
" you may as well call it impertinence at once .	3.1594729252360394
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	2.4210039872801348
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	2.909079287880273
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	2.9907785734378427
" no , she would go home .	5.696417039252018
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else mr . darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	2.0938327395136795
" he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	4.094999952864979
" you judge very properly , " said mr . bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	2.7149151372009945
" in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "	2.945556535648172
your tempers are by no means unlike .	5.148415181643667
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	2.5751919526946465
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	2.81784123559507
mrs . bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	2.3086271174910387
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u.s . federal laws and your state's laws .	2.051252644502522
" she is a very good kind of girl , i believe .	3.68725314541957
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .	4.894192526193169
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "	2.6967133597051114
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "	3.092170227781279
at present we have nothing to guide us .	4.001110311707915
in understanding darcy was the superior .	4.863134084990591
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?	3.79540516224804
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet .	2.947790809404535
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	2.6260333640490985
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	3.126217134833502
her report was highly favourable .	5.513719282278656
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	3.1269973245402083
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	2.098269129941522
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	2.1466971538774775
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	2.0965615473169223
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	2.6084809636680637
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	2.356886524593574
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and mr . bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	2.343720805876318
" and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good , " added kitty .	2.991195325053539
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	2.6628914584106647
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	2.7898010515719744
" yes ; to the last .	5.9076975232060365
" and this is your real opinion !	3.9988269164507395
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	2.4082471206051284
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	3.100129771690076
mr . bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	2.6883950731074187
i _should_ say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several . "	3.4823647411985923
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .	3.503442390256015
i do not deserve it .	6.075387462300569
mr . collins then returned to elizabeth .	4.611852467315076
let wickham be _your_ man .	5.5622580744296535
" take whatever you like , and get away . "	3.0349319533121553
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	3.481660010066537
" yes , or i will never see her again . "	2.9335927451263215
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point . "	2.6100063336726924
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs . bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	2.4710930450243214
how is such a man to be worked on ?	5.311719618883594
" i do not get on at all .	3.684012754746149
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	3.1824082944319843
nor was darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	2.685680483927406
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .	2.9414476482101035
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	6.1391769645959275
1.b .	104.36077079776408
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	2.4517599778188437
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .	2.7123643029191125
he is so excessively handsome !	5.968851969516586
mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	2.7052743125977043
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr . darcy .	3.6016753545857827
lydia--the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	2.2830800490095986
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .	3.009570175069588
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	2.9787249725935583
iii .	99.37775629993263
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	5.193686108041686
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	2.496728872701478
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	2.651111085024665
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr . bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . bennet's manor .	2.894829414393298
to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	2.5388495601462164
he added , that mr . bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon .	3.633141661827714
a lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	2.202770803146052
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	2.653313227859223
elizabeth was forced to go .	5.93396489326455
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	2.035261625128572
nothing could be more delightful !	7.5067810413406555
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .	5.329935974370617
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr . darcy's regard . "	3.144842493144723
" yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	2.7627935308564946
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	3.053450757258687
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . collins first came to hunsford . "	3.3920340507136637
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .	3.7561578732376173
in as short a time as mr . collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	2.4510987297078577
" my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "	3.1896634548322678
" no , my dear ; i think not .	4.410973783215841
cried bingley .	24.05468922107077
" oh , yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .	2.711310008734927
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable . "	3.541492943959331
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "	1.983569629556107
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "	2.452104642249306
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr . bingley .	3.3888587560667305
you may depend upon my seeking no further . "	3.1482287706071497
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	1.7530997423221515
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8 .	2.1025938553431494
" oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland . "	2.3610828001320994
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .	3.4402397164232483
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr .	3.3004588890068676
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	2.263262119109146
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	2.6157638809629398
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	2.64070602090701
" poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	3.4183987265381925
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .	1.9661576284419626
" you need not distress yourself .	5.256816813484476
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	2.865259342544019
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer .	3.853105052875844
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs . philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2.654182911338658
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .	2.7415298988665087
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "	3.3187266162828566
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . "	2.5059009513547807
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	2.4457852474086303
mr . bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	2.4201853489387295
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr .	2.2550072044357585
" very well .	10.371109676823854
elizabeth looked surprised .	10.026500430392675
then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet .	2.8977203065935178
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .	2.499760206725432
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	3.1649808383785576
will you come and see me ? "	4.0930280455417325
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	2.7364916908825165
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .	2.063129916623332
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	2.4659329694187
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection . "	2.5578585821221567
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .	2.3871156355673637
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . "	2.8539327788510747
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you .	2.819076105279441
must it be so ? "	6.931749699909026
miss lucas is married and settled .	4.529260280856467
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master ; she comes here to-morrow with him . "	2.0458964580779724
" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	2.7019828596733126
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	1.9209774189772344
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	2.7835568094493204
elizabeth longed to observe that mr . bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .	2.769037605399333
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .	2.4199099110177116
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away .	2.2766229801575513
you have liked many a stupider person . "	3.4575939528629247
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	2.9543614888812035
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	2.0151490636062492
as mrs . gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr . bennet came from it .	3.8001776371250524
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	3.8298320947111315
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "	2.6669806196710577
" had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? "	3.7389161171257217
compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never .	3.1915891687322495
chapter xii .	13.68867928861669
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "	2.068776628006184
he is gone to my father already .	4.8511672705087445
she is quite a little creature .	5.013513950864642
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs . hurst and miss bingley .	3.0824785652423676
oh !	19.31992947065936
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	2.718838868856012
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .	3.38076614920602
" and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body . "	2.5227760664383485
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "	2.3476610827957267
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake ; and for your _own_ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	1.8789908401367383
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	2.452089014049552
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not .	3.8193495711403402
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	3.696904154830426
" with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "	2.904604614672609
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	2.349451177872066
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "	2.4184584957552597
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that mr . jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better .	2.937326561542934
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )	2.9743888410784174
i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	2.2504728109519356
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _being created_ . "	3.8475579677439233
a great deal more passed at the other table .	4.310639369738584
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	2.834890786599285
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ . "	2.815569620689887
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . "	2.250323897786926
mr . collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while mrs . bennet was stirring the fire .	2.6772924660863313
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	3.191216470833717
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	2.8624086726233844
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs . bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2.3297789445805717
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	2.4209106005967005
" i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	2.926014205299256
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	2.77642651655584
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	2.1389993792480984
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .	3.022335452817103
" nothing child , nothing .	5.483244555343047
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret .	2.545211010671594
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr . collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	2.408493916633395
" yes;--but he seemed to like his second better . "	3.3181050090480575
the day passed much as the day before had done .	3.914447872401894
to mr . darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .	3.669312028627827
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	2.239868236862786
in that case he would return no more .	3.98602044551195
said he , smiling .	9.660184224583032
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	2.5614045745822973
i have not the smallest hope .	4.784400824136057
we have heard nothing from town . "	3.748360534671541
mrs . bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	2.932697532183798
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	3.6023588481571442
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	2.6533100871758495
" what do you mean , hill ?	3.7290311183574474
" compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	2.431996764520239
why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more . "	2.8325636064441277
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	3.241470406992314
" not one . "	6.64598988872607
i cannot do justice to his kindness .	4.083131025786575
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	2.350676489297028
u.s . laws alone swamp our small staff .	3.506161696726659
" nearly three weeks . "	5.306551290904373
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry .	2.785221872534826
it seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	2.264937227013206
mrs . reynolds could interest her on no other point .	3.099358140441987
collins . "	13.89244237206579
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	2.544175093115192
" i do not mind his not talking to mrs . long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza . "	3.221080861943429
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "	2.812967745403666
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	2.670095425967725
i will think no more about him . "	3.845237686991397
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her .	4.086617713637309
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	2.086578034909182
mr . and mrs . gardiner smiled .	5.555331031404445
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	2.5955019646514668
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .	2.8073961073213205
" is my father in town ? "	4.299338686937988
the officer was the very mr . denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	2.509585104167256
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .	3.247020057332469
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs . collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	2.613639091944576
it was to be such a secret ! "	5.050473693424951
lord !	101.4427172003468
" yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "	2.0953665975863465
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .	3.7027282276614124
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that .	2.5726197015053165
" there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	3.149813788127555
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . "	3.1551835508997583
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "	2.367525384528638
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	3.3024656302309583
" _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza , " said charlotte .	3.8324432158791204
said she , as she looked in her face .	6.664937724514507
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	2.2078595445914257
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham .	2.662308890208792
" what do you mean , mr . bennet , by talking in this way ?	3.950848907140692
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "	2.4998788576902093
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	2.7978877742761155
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . gardiner thought of him , and mrs . gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	2.9427343780319415
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay .	2.9989435620097384
" i am perfectly convinced by it that mr . darcy has no defect .	3.6620456969497797
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs . bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for . "	3.1360238909176394
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .	3.486614763756242
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	3.0462262418263695
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty .	2.579338869791866
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .	3.067175949512003
1.f.6 .	104.36077079776408
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	2.7739631011415837
mr . darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet . "	3.201430239580728
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	3.6199035506836292
i shall now know how to act .	4.715260936439561
--and upon elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr .	2.218241977806938
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity .	2.4558197416412244
oh !	19.31992947065936
special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark .	2.2724696085091347
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	2.39131862225703
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	3.2675270520413067
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "	2.466611798650823
in short , i will do my best . "	5.143755179710806
" no ; but it must be done soon . "	4.4819791580523916
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	2.1082854434718006
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	3.0786159703860543
but our visitor was very obstinate .	4.637152980052715
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	3.575188058112426
during dinner , mr . bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	2.4551768875487303
" oh !	4.947216533565322
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	2.6441190133837473
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _child_ ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	2.020060510523255
those were your words .	7.287228485116901
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .	2.8174373955409937
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	2.928323452336357
" how abominable!--i wonder that the very pride of this mr . darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it . "	2.3017511889606133
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "	3.279256930271851
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "	2.1339426993345363
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	1.9615846017613239
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	2.8195846845749077
i hate such false friends .	5.1581623693877665
mrs . gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	2.158007622219679
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	3.0094008947672597
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . "	3.5881008059747286
how can mr . bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	2.9089959083465806
i must find mr . gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . "	2.8637010795247586
" as soon as ever mr . bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs . bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "	3.642002536364955
darcy ! "	11.6126425396636
i dare say i shall soon see them here . "	3.5462790038396323
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	2.237818953689497
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .	2.7698069906514378
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr .	2.9894394799877633
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	2.4580509629909044
my dear , " continued mrs . bennet , " i am quite delighted with him .	4.181901855094614
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	2.493785016309967
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "	3.038628226408688
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	3.036103422961048
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	2.5608897769298515
" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle .	3.108329779562854
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	2.087823990005885
" pray tell your sister that i long to see her . "	2.867879430257432
let me mend it for you .	4.474673127863349
change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "	2.3942663254652268
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .	3.5853389387322347
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .	4.747372747084822
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	2.87168434635977
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr . bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	2.300942760019922
at length the parsonage was discernible .	4.306351038299956
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	2.490155688493123
" that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "	3.0195375437404035
" oh , well !	6.813162846059145
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . "	3.8612812750192482
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . darcy's proposals .	2.952017694724865
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . "	2.173728438091474
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .	2.7687154076112175
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	2.900788044757903
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .	5.06156611432567
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	2.207489664198913
she really looked almost wild . "	4.457872597015223
it was at sir william lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	3.2040242858184222
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .	2.479283044654861
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch .	3.6436723556312343
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	3.9246457043306475
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	4.15081236070321
mr . darcy !	8.220996147619982
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .	5.473190213475508
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	2.3602144505005263
in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations .	2.090405500202713
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	3.015234038624348
darcy ? "	11.617565663992835
bingley will not be detained in london by them . "	3.9412833511090177
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .	2.682663882554061
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	2.741238901239588

" your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .	2.9997700825289857
" lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say .	5.258636952595255
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia's marriage .	2.8654296916466686
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	5.273844878501003
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr . darcy .	2.7249416734679572
mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .	2.5880937409318494
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	2.431037872727651
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "	1.9961857304115247
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . and mrs . gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	2.8538244753849877
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .	2.625221364352876
as soon as jane had read mr . gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	2.4226632789696443
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	2.210137396576839
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been .	2.4456605085049774
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	3.698443647560293
" oh , yes !	6.122574231272771
" mrs . annesley is with her .	4.590209309068356
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable .	3.3160280847319012
" that is a question which mr . darcy only can answer . "	3.6468509610092568
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	2.832594210271241
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	2.3890078614009105
i ought not to have said a word about it .	3.5012983748607134
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	3.3121186378896414
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well .	3.020290668098006
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	3.1523498174843736
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	3.171819637657168
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	3.6185925058227784
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs . bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	3.1437128165072523
" haye-park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !	2.5309019475101207
a house in town !	8.350237339948455
and with a bow to mr . darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many stared.--many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	2.40245082997738
he takes them now for people of fashion . "	3.261864185967981
oh , brother , how kind you are !	3.9573116606796472
cried elizabeth .	10.329309900021203
those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "	3.1045461266074095
" my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .	2.7096867120070534
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "	2.650572105115943
" mr . collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "	2.5601903581996757
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	2.4206736733834595
well , any friend of mr . bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "	2.5323936146288726
bromley , of course.--if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . "	2.809706787748896
you need not .	12.849593383491149
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .	3.0581858717873844
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	2.528192983166865
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . "	4.471525659456161
pride and prejudice : a novel .	4.150198619952503
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	4.244539424208032
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	3.6075982408705625
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . "	2.4443860611663304
when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .	2.7162467678860747
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me!--they were excessively sorry to go !	2.5744984415083967
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	2.18462642473334
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	3.3501181900259245
" but you--how are you ? "	4.168116306609159
it is too long ago .	5.622108594013672
" he only told me , what i have now told you . "	3.410209388563556
" i should like it beyond any thing ! "	3.2769835859735537
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement .	2.7555614409042914
they have some of the finest woods in the country . "	3.3753029195770727
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage . "	4.311856586459405
this cannot be !	10.306690130297746
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	2.19664335496975
she did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	2.64952293072482
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	2.5516717203180495
it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	2.710019621564439
she was gone directly .	7.590299410820957
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	2.3850000494623105
" certainly not ; at first .	4.556587020819068
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor . "	3.1501447037827885
chapter iv .	13.68867928861669
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	1.9827934311165962
" that is as it happens .	4.8821314782707805
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin .	2.1762180058918674
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "	3.0015492105398485
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	2.515967068475838
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	3.3010595113484835
who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	2.139835228473291
i was never more annoyed !	5.61209279797447
do not distress me by the idea .	4.664641032775819
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .	2.6844815771823813
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent .	4.313827768754013
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza !	2.9733359770581136
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	2.4276389396194626
" you have .	9.224170469085177
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	2.4984150897528563
'lady catherine,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure.'	4.51489242028098
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .	2.92915685566007
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	2.4147437607031756
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr . darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr . and mrs . gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .	2.7868627704285656
it was all pride and insolence .	4.502612306534701
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	2.576898994488817
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	2.3516810519037894
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character . "	2.7776774656225487
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	1.965172640150208
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	3.725578489873801
do not let us quarrel about the past .	3.966868887820813
not a soul knew of it , but col . and mrs . forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	2.5644785766102607
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .	3.0811844227295366
my sisters may write to _me_ .	4.807649682053532
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	2.0848477744332703
good gracious !	19.319513353477507
" you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr . bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	3.5447432886235286
i will speak to her about it myself directly .	3.5952950357277955
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	2.5222933791355033
no , no , you shall not deceive me .	3.6816479725921467
the second began .	11.076175707678397
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	4.970812923686796
they must be a great loss to _your_ family . "	3.250377626688847
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " lydia declared herself satisfied .	2.776638203655603
_she_ will not be able to help calling . "	4.93922454717256
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	2.514664411042184
gardiner . "	15.194908995959628
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr . darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr . collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	2.6640656286909863
and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "	2.6338577876284623
mrs . long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "	2.4793450448494427
they were all astonished ; and mr . bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir?--you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . "	2.309140869038185
charlotte the wife of mr . collins , was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	2.24512869713973
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	3.104972722817839
i do not know who is good enough for him . "	2.9764019866870433
of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	2.426610319331441
no one made any reply .	5.309616002050093
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	1.9743276740586193
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	3.0797756602507738
" i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr . bennet .	3.7748486485265285
without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	2.361624583995108
" i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .	3.3793977655568446
" but if you have got them to-day , " said elizabeth , " my mother's purpose will be answered . "	3.0468822532830213
mr . bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	2.2613431460654154
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	2.3928725631081686
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr . collins , in describing the civility of mr . and mrs . philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .	2.224289740964386
bennet ? "	20.372660117798
mrs . gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	2.5244786231060705
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . bingley !	3.1172415993182083
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	2.217711094470094
i _must_ have employment and society .	4.382646854396261
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	2.3912702043715903
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	2.229955667290116
and then when we came away it was such fun !	3.7502848470006205
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	4.992948000503325
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses .	2.952233027806449
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .	3.8024461122672144
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr . collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	2.1165290221417354
as for your elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "	2.469692483961498
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . darcy's progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	2.269606348178736
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	3.7511207087372083
thought elizabeth .	24.157515837915703
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	2.780744696921871
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . "	2.4620806914554754
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	2.1256011448425545
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	2.523428937937274
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr . darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ .	2.3780145969407713
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .	3.4310018516554117
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	3.469983920309218
'tis as good as a lord !	5.556956137979556
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? "	3.480202230976839
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs . bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	2.2809341996685077
" and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ? "	2.56403198391786
so much the better .	5.043829908943902
" not as you represent it .	4.329025976981527
chapter x . elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	2.592896267271097
not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend . "	2.2905942957644077
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	2.784670287744678
" i am afraid you do not like your pen .	3.8212443414183053
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .	2.999766658644822
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	4.0322015002175196
" but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs . long has promised to introduce him . "	3.0488351203666553
they were to be off as soon as possible .	5.062261624152013
as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	2.2453175362956377
cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be?--how could his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress ? "	2.438766037551947
" when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .	3.546730725920062
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living .	3.2273292632501054
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . "	4.186493017624544
" no , i should have turned in a moment . "	3.515686737199034
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here . "	3.7381864785439487
and who knows what _may_ happen ?	4.386914281641429
nonsense , how can you talk so !	5.182960118279636
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	2.5724647749341782
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .	4.959906237479157
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .	3.0074058089595654
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton .	2.4218867316836117
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	2.057521088513794
elizabeth was now to see mr . wickham for the last time .	4.8646892028154785
i told my sister philips so the other day .	4.213532882372711
a most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house !	5.022440888166533
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle .	3.280075405542583
there was also a postscript to this effect .	3.1979599397292993
mrs . bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	2.420714181504824
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .	2.77209475603121
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	3.565754909438032
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	2.5284276750318564
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "	3.5146660765871633
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "	3.3699075380353305
" undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	2.3133157157054196
" and men take care that they should . "	3.739053402555009
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	3.5910162298224333
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . "	2.4463539274002093
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .	3.079728103791761
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .	2.544951574176601
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .	3.135197480289149
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .	2.385215756957928
mr . darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	2.9027775742433537
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	2.5621826380563784
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	2.43238491866395
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	2.911926959721315
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "	2.220870954008083
1813 .	43.86690853635113
bingley ? "	13.372106442979343
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	2.4958871258760893
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted---- " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .	2.414462256671613
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	3.066549383086519
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	3.3807887430684436
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	2.2720869220291138
are you going much farther ? "	4.09616781546698
mr .	6.495854594468836
indeed , mr . darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . "	2.2692757079126387
" and is this all ? "	4.392411732208099
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	2.766706221075553
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .	3.059208676145641
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	2.8414357689289313
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself .	2.9507830027177033
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	2.5715304883602577
" mr . collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	2.441894766998445
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	2.480510746885708
but she is nothing to me now .	4.7611719051603485

" thank you--but i always mend my own . "	3.12698881765599
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .	2.289537533951675
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	3.573737771789439
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	3.3847804491543823

" and you saw him frequently ? "	3.8821417727006526
the tête-à-tête surprised them .	7.0376238085593705
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "	3.118613296500277
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	2.3295261976489474
" what do you mean ? "	3.462407406173853
there was no help for it however .	4.421203132830052
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs . collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	2.621565469475355
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "	2.708385280113196
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	2.8086523963412797
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can.--but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without . "	2.577622512534098
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	2.99591649323816
you see on what a footing we are .	3.743352949255908
" some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know . "	4.193966465205373
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	2.6016840744707186
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "	2.259230506966053
her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	3.2112743127185617
they are my old friends .	5.033130144269131
" _i_ never saw such a woman .	5.229367276853277

he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	2.2840838157897907
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "	2.9520258206118757
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	7.087312121326903
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .	4.302063739816436
from his garden , mr . collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	2.2733236231765415
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "	2.2029391711128765
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "	2.503333953903117
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	2.5383049623013605
in a doleful voice mrs . bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"oh !	3.583271346138866
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	3.525538058723368
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	2.6080645037975208
mrs . bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .	2.497334665188204
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	2.941498483775316
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs . forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .	2.2894097869046814
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	2.806989327612381

elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . wickham and herself .	3.6180536537142336
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	3.263716831158069
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	3.3293390773581133
" and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? "	2.819687267702546
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "	2.5336661709389183
you must not disappoint your father . "	4.040481932661036
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . "	2.429332157302762
her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	3.1127257361929885
mrs . bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last.'	3.8864781321534108
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	3.4466050248100246
" oh !	4.947216533565322
but will they make you happy ? "	3.81599658814204
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	2.267624619550031
" oh , yes!--he was to come there with wickham , you know .	3.428575947469295
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	2.327935814008669
said jane.--"i certainly saw mr . darcy speaking to her . "	4.26942777793356
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs . hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet .	2.2134874014500387
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	2.9581492650822976
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it .	2.9682430921338083
oh !	19.31992947065936
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	3.2312974317493177
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "	2.092421154069993
younger sons cannot marry where they like . "	3.7742849427726264
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "	2.932401971787642
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	2.285308837803016
" for the liveliness of your mind , i did . "	3.39914659828737
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .	3.70047567659936
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	3.1446328426375265
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . "	2.8454686429638185
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . "	3.378515296599592
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	2.2304705851060005
" i do not see what right mr . darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . "	2.5199561671762805
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?	3.326507649910798
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	2.026897018558642
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	3.168595100227898
she had a sister married to a mr . philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .	2.70569958393208
yes--i understand you perfectly . "	5.55552002248609
" oh , lord !	4.756608298242942
his doing so drew her notice .	4.284877098918863
on mr . and mrs . gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	2.9168443140977645
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "	2.378179053814876
he studies too much for words of four syllables.--do not you , darcy ? "	2.764279130078613
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	3.4761732434792796
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	2.0803389772611003
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .	4.402138523187617

my reasons for believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	2.188154747134862
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? "	3.4963591476496654
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	1.816060918273644
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	2.8984184674905986
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .	2.6725676159249163
it mortifies me .	10.631551054520468
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	2.7442423023867533
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	2.3180951636063605
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "	2.385407346909839
" certainly .	19.63376135791408
this is your final resolve !	5.571667814493991
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "	2.316446341707202
i can hardly write for laughing .	4.560969291962153
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	3.300145094296681
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s regiment . "	3.4848724635053365
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	3.0967302118648274
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .	2.864815638552359
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	2.767673595999046
kitty , run down and order the carriage .	3.6562935231670535
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	2.3383344736391956
to mr . bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	2.3893465238603944
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	2.539192680066755
but who was your mother ?	5.645878916757749
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	2.846628004346456
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	2.3500789194910614
" i hope , " added mrs . gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	3.423492889385362
your mother insists upon your accepting it .	3.6847065224891478
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	2.882826424877255
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	2.5107327039653726
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr . darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	2.973755190976581
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	2.8642052361562973
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "	2.6193764389751566
" i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .	3.3467458319521968
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "	2.377823994776783
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	2.3329474976860056
but there are two things that i want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him . "	2.3112604298231165
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .	3.872860044536413
1.e.6 .	104.36077079776408
_that_ is all settled . "	5.656882838216115
i know your disposition , lizzy .	4.666008933629881
mrs . bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ?	3.14652182718575
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	2.7692284641456117
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr . darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	2.7257815123807645
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	2.8293968800458744
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .	2.04416746368653
" a gamester ! "	6.092383417802674
a few weeks , he believed .	5.188323613477862
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	2.5406912147653786
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	3.442909939319522
my temper i dare not vouch for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	2.346447714448595
oh !	19.31992947065936
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	2.4956138495603626
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte's marriage .	2.7006376279731197
" it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "	2.800254319452955
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . "	2.302021758592899
" nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility .	3.7136063009826152
no.--i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "	3.330316876926696
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	2.082008130680831
mrs . bennet could hardly comprehend it .	4.258216217405334
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	2.0348115567818326
" i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . "	2.587252334526787
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	3.757170477299153
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "	2.0859178224607113
we must have mrs . long and the gouldings soon .	3.8117483199505893
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	2.48523024898822
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "	2.4528322017643096
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	2.5170959222179126
the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	2.751058360388211
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .	3.230973198038418
" yes--the late mr . darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	3.047955930517325
a carat character is used to denote superscription .	3.312580539392973
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	2.4251061871106008
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "	3.7081894446828847
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced . "	4.1774491673161895
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . philips's .	2.705158458686936
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	4.0511645662751645
" why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned .	3.0557196373961135
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	2.0875778311127973
" she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "	2.9532196223880582
" dearest jane !	11.670936975459039
" oh !	4.947216533565322
elizabeth was delighted .	9.784033096056035
" that is very strange .	5.364736679469202
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	2.933884985142545
what does he say ?	7.78366371436806
excuse me--for i must speak plainly .	5.516521458673534
bingley ? "	13.372106442979343
what am i to do ? "	4.765413269912998
" no , not at all . "	4.035279060319553
" and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? "	3.4109827394937646
section 1 .	20.932041876175994
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" oh ! "	3.3178953880826065
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . james's had made him courteous .	2.3865040249220444
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "	3.038757805702606
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	3.6160011153252927
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	2.7569340373929645
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	2.3614916616919217
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	3.107058657000342
mr . darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	2.953603103050576
" and that , " said mrs . reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master--and very like him .	2.9048760109790503
it is what every body says .	4.901170047174829
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .	4.03135165114263
teaze him--laugh at him.--intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "	3.2662596973834424
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .	3.329447705370438
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	2.740657689779317
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "	3.2684199374606244
i cannot understand it .	7.0706983566157104
" yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside . "	2.7614294002351065
" and this is always the way with him , " she added.--"whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	2.7841457303650707
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr . wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	2.1633415374936615
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	3.2655981190148244
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .	4.682251899324565
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	3.0990439594239465
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "	3.0813138496604737
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	3.6136531804856333
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	4.495776599786567
" yes , in conjunction with his friend . "	3.0108722778323807
but when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	2.0503665036032594
only look at her .	7.910524565502236
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	2.3426924433360172
i have by no means done .	6.258923611360529
but slyness seems the fashion .	5.248978241335169
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .	5.2176526907961
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .	2.526821054506787
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . "	2.453955390608488
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	2.315143437405578
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ .	2.9620695953006893
" why will you think so ?	5.623964161243148
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	2.353883594014994
perhaps i am not doing her justice .	5.768318643782277
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	2.876710773417423
mr . darcy bowed .	8.783069492167535
" not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	3.3956466970792243
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	2.2557436704821137
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .	3.1921729548967215
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?	3.8054956667113613
i did not wink at you . "	4.165618419650666
" not so hasty , if you please .	4.522830280381851
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	2.4847459182624294
mr . bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it.--mr .	2.2666245084052523
now what have you to say ? "	4.625024521171002
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	3.5991791000772886
" well , and what news does it bring ?	4.062815310376556
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	3.2053261475485617
" i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	2.4086097327415303
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	2.317302055758914
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs . bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh !	2.545549663999364
i will read it to you-- " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	2.2121432208085725
" yes , ma'am , all . "	3.7025987358524057
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	3.362742187208616
mr . bingley arrived .	9.147157094523681
their sister's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	2.9293407113063754
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	2.2460580741809992
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . "	4.386139025635076
" good gracious !	6.159512110684653
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	1.9532407103782377
when mr . collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	2.7748311558826573
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her .	2.776942631348166
" i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied .	3.1316095841154303
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet . "	3.613101953598982
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	2.241339836204006
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .	2.3329212964686903
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	2.2957775421800823
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !	4.274113464451545
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	3.3249834283737063
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	3.8971608156456843
mrs . bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	2.734355876749229
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	2.8940545460063576
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "	2.573728389009983
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	3.175013741028211
" i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "	2.840256606121878
" yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing .	3.8474607738967292
he begged pardon for having displeased her .	3.8619137959579146
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr . bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	2.699474190984216
" oh !	4.947216533565322
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	2.9146036550318164
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "	2.373467206662399
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	2.6971448055370737
for my part , mr . bingley , _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently .	2.3554092297481057
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair .	2.514986337698311
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs . bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	2.6438263150164656
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again . "	3.127650220991689
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	2.4167016473191456
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to-day ?	2.900096960058633
shocking ! "	23.220119905628636
" perhaps i do .	7.295726202455247
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr .	4.045313176854294

" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	3.2046678662126546
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	2.723038785100958
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "	3.5882894595598396
from the entrance hall , of which mr . collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	2.601222533860014
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	2.7357617034688846
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . collins's side , and as many bows on sir william's , they departed .	2.7406661487728865
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	2.638274438193402
catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .	3.024587668876087
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "	2.260489197798888
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	3.805060892854509
and so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	3.0924066645556194
" can you deny that you have done it ? "	3.736875219480451
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	2.341292992750261
yes;--there is nothing in that .	7.455372026959768
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	2.664727575768915
" in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defective .	3.545490123631212
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals . "	2.092757533709298
" yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . "	2.5704955297625127
the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . "	2.7283127320306346
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	2.5342999584732384

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	2.3320444331456196

" do you suppose them to be in london ? "	3.843150993835154
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	2.783938591261663
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	3.045121032172073
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham .	2.345642761717062
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	3.081837054809083
" very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .	3.790737079613643
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	2.26178996906836
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	5.256808949248144
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	2.9257321172939017
the loo table , however , did not appear .	5.825489032237005
" complied with !	11.263298988662113
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way . "	2.8936848666604122
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody's_ reserve , can be answerable for the event .	2.2248025865551893
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening .	2.5909201801211523
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	2.825786267866179
mr . darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	3.7840310943089968
" nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	2.958580866321942
chapter xii .	13.68867928861669
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . "	2.032679933275132
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	2.674835619877462
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	2.4290245717576826
" it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud .	4.399806850103335
i am the happiest creature in the world .	4.2264612975006814
how are you all ? "	5.288694189609034
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr . collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	2.9798414540852605
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible .	2.193723332947825
i mend pens remarkably well . "	4.225139236054745
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	2.777261452504746
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	2.350747751027494
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	3.3881198901657066

_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her's_ she thought was still worse .	2.9247418046586984
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	2.9232780941182344
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _them_ .	3.306026878776491
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	2.5516129257967695
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "	2.4564558138216346
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then observed , " your father's estate is entailed on mr . collins , i think .	2.2989360138713937
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	2.611500111012686
" if you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .	3.0272994217240488
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	2.4227136497095243
but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	2.772947576853995
the farewell between herself and mr . wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .	3.5238474515601905
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	3.930529161841245
i speak feelingly .	10.036658981038329
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	2.3079506820520477
mr . gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror .	2.5568610558580604
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr .	2.63794930566003
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . "	2.9279561303049406
i thought i should have died .	4.993211469099821
" upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "	2.419412524471261
things are settled so oddly . "	4.641499675787907
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	2.096952647350307
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	3.490744687534571
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "	2.6653863990940243
" i have no right to give _my_ opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	3.1909771572840944
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "	3.071111400521238
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .	2.89919940032949
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	2.2051541035780917
very well .	21.205979249709547
" our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "	2.132014687439608
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .	2.968372535385175
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	2.284496907618732
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .	2.744443359683444
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married .	4.674414727592946
" well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose .	3.7851009595200806
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs . gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	3.1255595131787475
you must learn some of my philosophy .	4.025822728221374
" but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . "	2.9871463677734043
you blamed me for coming ? "	4.506354801777186
on the following monday , mrs . bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .	3.032553774536832
" some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_ .	2.8454927657430282
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	2.2247411593952826
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	2.4014831952285878
" i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	2.8026302005262607
our poor mother is sadly grieved .	4.846534691473448
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	2.7042197588898613
" as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable . "	3.4499835124676927
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	2.3505966684228374
" but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "	2.4189715208731513
he replied , and was again silent .	8.53492544885659
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest .	4.179190573727047
" indeed i am .	6.955153923375778
he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	3.2393455387695953
georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	2.0725398565683535
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .	2.797727054492531
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	2.3857804858391094
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	3.942405640389245
her reflections were in general satisfactory .	4.961163049724708
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	3.244607145266336
" no--why should he ?	7.08065372573828
" yours , &c . " " well , my dear , " said mr . bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . bingley , and under your orders . "	2.837309490098301
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over .	2.1902055247188374
" and my mother--how is she ?	4.225987685081448
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	3.4715568838516826
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	3.0964403935483067
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	2.7885256792640423
" indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	2.8967394988873685
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	2.4845784975752867
mrs . collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	2.645282662665063
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	2.4770956377347892
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	3.470345384560016
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "	2.5089837199304603
" so much the better .	4.055475170968739
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	2.992673391165867
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	3.6977724059678088
in lydia's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	2.6154254567740582
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .	2.5940368120832424
i did not think mrs . gardiner was so little to be trusted . "	3.8109256408596988
i quite detest the man . "	4.44391558773125
" well , then--supposing them to be in london .	4.052015762740098
that his two sisters and mr . darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	2.9363565586656
who could have done less for her ?	4.873809636341961
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	2.296231726090005
" but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return . "	2.564974567822434
but i know the foundation is unjust .	4.402731714476864
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	3.5590128857094667
she replied in the affirmative .	6.5252578150633935
" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "	2.712872566322858
oh , lizzy !	9.617624336557846
mrs . gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	2.4429103587606944
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .	3.2787961212005774
" but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "	3.0078689301907833
mr . collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs . bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	1.9819588475599392
" have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "	3.0237291088051683
" oh , yes!--if one could but go to brighton !	2.816927646475328
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "	2.195980432951253
" i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	2.7063431302551635
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .	2.692194118433534
" it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "	2.895569480124341
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .	3.670406130348359
miss darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	2.591346352215494
i only hope they may have half my good luck .	3.4443226868200525
good bye .	13.69067164101196
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	2.4955107998923065
said her aunt .	14.08773904275055
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	2.2874701205611268
did he know of their intending to go off ?	3.8824873793579395
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr . darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? "	2.553656109780796
" what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? "	3.9013471993756705
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	3.027773840816965
jane looked at her doubtingly .	6.48464621397259
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	2.3447353828257165
they walked on , without knowing in what direction .	4.2407201606347575
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	3.8583812783321543
" i had much rather go in the coach . "	3.0316823952636414
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .	3.6363237621960898
before any answer could arrive from mr . collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .	3.0791257019872584
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .	3.1056407665695436
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	2.435675092961164
mr . wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing mr . collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .	2.4622698197549613
" to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	2.3983812235174025
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	2.4760899145357906
but i will not repine .	5.9744704093348675
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "	2.0422938551934555
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "	4.254882290618671
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	2.233958885736801
but perhaps mr . bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "	2.557282171565183
* * * * * transcriber's note : spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book .	2.1960857850727367
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "	2.5472461129551855
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	2.2341585437463864
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	2.2132668915802083
he has heartily forgiven me now . "	3.45750204879768
" you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "	2.854791656592279
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise--all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	2.406318870495398
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs . long .	4.113986616454083
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	2.210534667677358
are quite well . "	7.055785840281899
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	2.111474853909011
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately .	3.6710580639068473
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "	2.6629135573580283
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	4.231881538488217
i am prodigiously proud of him .	4.438066640694667
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	2.596526398027567
elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	3.2669776794812933
" ah ! "	7.387459591565764
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "	2.792356309868082
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	2.4420205611919914
in a few days mr . bingley returned mr . bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	3.264293261277093
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	2.2450930892466903
" how i long to see her again !	4.2783027287267155
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	2.8533004461219234
chapter xviii .	11.504358223205136
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .	2.6284709935577877
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	2.7958824328353336
you must and shall be married by a special licence .	3.1134529304204155
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr . collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	3.2904939414653964
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "	2.6677342749378696
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	2.604614366109811
" most willingly . "	7.008104280629805
we will go round the park every day .	3.869826587512589
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	2.9565279969326608
at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	2.298198497182902
" my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	2.8835016200601373
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	2.5191279055055813
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	2.88371170234776
poor lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	3.2828934897570043
i hope they will not meet at all .	4.286043491976296
-- " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .	4.1960651657131125
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	2.9451686895874336
" a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .	4.028398138661094
said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ? "	3.5639726265072857
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	2.768758800155376
she certainly did not hate him .	4.638924952541336
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .	3.83966353195439
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	2.7193641548293117
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	3.3097749224122497
" yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor . "	2.6350102750174034
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone .	2.0817504543423233
its completion depended on others .	5.095872842593662
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .	2.6126419183877045
" much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "	3.2443736190169865
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	2.4578529715916417
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .	2.4974907857869484
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .	4.7034206219055825
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . darcy's looks and behaviour .	3.1183020997672326
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	4.178911186535526
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	2.804643141589097
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing?--mr .	2.7963051128831085
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	2.5156166771705553
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase " project gutenberg " associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .	1.9960172097046454
the hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	2.375933354528259
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	2.6596832410120226
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	2.216968646634238
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	2.6749220710858186
" i must not decide on my own performance . "	3.171917907387407
have all her friends left her ? "	4.323149402255691
the first part of mrs . gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	2.492029250952273
chapter x .	11.504358223205136
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "	2.3538984669503416
" my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .	3.453622935369597
his most particular friend , you see by jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	2.6399992062854434
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	3.944435848041294
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "	2.247018487712731
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .	4.028771731197765
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .	3.0068957523297497
what do you keep winking at me for ?	4.275433210901798
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	2.778703222297372
it is highly improper .	6.638519523327552
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	2.400519780283668
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	2.6428152787158785
* * * * * mr . gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	3.397270716161355
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "	4.185622351572591
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante . "	3.4901363852760716
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	2.9752104905332684
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . bennet's ill humour or ill health .	3.21023600462028
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	3.4278716653969403
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain .	2.953621956903896
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	2.0257406164557716
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	3.8730371580020972
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	2.4792578257015068
mrs . bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	2.9285294654463425
i do think mrs . long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . "	2.4452029745122177
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	2.5090659015156045
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	2.438541086590936
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	3.1019183928737237
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved .	3.2703906487306837
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	2.5489132118665356
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	3.3997978120264216
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	3.2120925538050065
" oh ! "	3.3178953880826065
" well , so much the better .	3.726621792350283
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	3.5505373158336626
" caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .	2.7738296159066236
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	2.883396888500224
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	2.3846467683718444
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	2.23294227397194
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	2.542485444547686
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	2.2481018946481015
dear , yes;--but you must own she is very plain .	3.484682303925324
and on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan't come and part us , i am determined .	3.1225424862240785
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	3.49949554022202
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	3.6804095693023844
" pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "	2.759739162733916
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	2.3361325436449567
not these two or three years perhaps . "	4.403262678540498
mr . bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	2.608587291298394
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr . gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .	2.873612335183961
oh , lord !	8.675584982864061
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	2.59524391011714
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .	2.638810226571064
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	3.041753107919685
darcy . "	11.570328720106236
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed . "	2.6510106134914824
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	2.2114441279213355
my dear charles , what do you mean ? "	3.3385553563214407
" to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	3.1713085370294936
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	3.220813307950206
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	4.285507403789164
mr . bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .	3.2823693766103825
if there _were_ but such another man for you ! "	2.8853627244374476
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	3.2397314114229734
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	3.479251521643026
" upon my word!--well , that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "	2.138537040089148
mr . darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	2.498004877783648
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.'	2.7105984716997265
i do not believe she often sees such at home . "	2.7757783867839114
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	2.9954729444858947
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .	2.1601483679638607
have you heard from my uncle ? "	4.206129793800576
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .	2.6672952268438994
" what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "	2.6308940362856847
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter .	2.2937617758457653
but that is nothing to us .	5.69524526653414
" your examination of mr . darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley;--"and pray what is the result ? "	3.2719592167383706
" while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough.--i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	2.514609943937427
" yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	2.350841907997092
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	2.586305003135584
" perfectly so--i thank you . "	4.256230317620263
" an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _us_ .	3.616256902884744
and now here's mr . bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	3.0970440727896005
to mrs . gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	2.890016763605956
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .	3.255827823588901
" mr . darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling .	4.309097585134444
his character was to speak for itself .	4.052973238505606
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "	2.5196051686483174
not that i care about it , though .	4.5911353638419445
[ illustration : dove-dale ] pride & prejudice .	2.849424800223434
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .	2.8476946435797896
her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	3.611007709781944
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .	2.790654521161063
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	2.1016471896054933
her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "	3.308932437061354
gardiner . "	15.194908995959628
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	2.830678978767778
" i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	2.235027931697281
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . "	3.0257964510261015
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	2.8447924937797335
mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted .	3.3031787652772855
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	2.659069618661718
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr . darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	2.781834024277917
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .	4.115156787868883
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "	2.6318893215924817
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me;--though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "	2.354780328250969
" i am afraid , mr . darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "	3.0813218711644175
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . "	2.564621935234758
mr . gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	2.5995182932952265
i am going away myself . "	4.340308707818159
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	2.553809209198836
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	3.1054422924144247
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	3.3312228363896907
said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i'm the tallest . "	2.9378772021091195
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "	3.4367440881304754
collins . "	13.89244237206579
oh !	19.31992947065936
cried his wife impatiently .	9.049679315927575
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life .	2.568491175775719
" oh ! "	3.3178953880826065
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	2.120819373697198
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	2.5475780452768335
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	2.5928917058834178
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	3.299392266075529
mr . collins on his return highly gratified mrs . bennet by admiring mrs . philips's manners and politeness .	3.096232795360596
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "	2.8688001621296952
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	3.18551698927656
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	4.244184482425101
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	3.209574615938475
" i never saw any one so shocked .	3.6624928323708135
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	2.4944805098029015
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find .	3.7008690489800213
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	2.297083114958064
" and they _must_ marry !	4.971423198353089
" she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	2.4250124036083185
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . reynolds was of no trifling nature .	3.270712436666495
oh , sister !	11.010687224775136
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	3.2046697004091733
" you must not blame my aunt .	4.848156779349265
at that moment , she cared for no other .	3.793348557242624
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .	3.2626107210111157
" can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "	2.4682334658258362
at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "	2.9370197278797265
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .	2.5308142678987218
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	2.5840591726912785
mr . darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	4.048158187210727
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	3.024338325966384
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened .	5.896118667011613
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	2.2626336491118146
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	2.2379510675250613
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	3.517263929223166
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . wickham .	2.7100792203188555
mrs . collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure . "	3.5707601178003183
philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	3.268240452012211
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	2.743905736669116
" i have heard much of your master's fine person , " said mrs . gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .	3.1871536602586765
" indeed , mr . bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it ! "	2.621364870350445
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr . wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	2.2867187742916597
it is of all subjects my delight .	3.8438518629860963
that lady i suppose is your mother . "	3.792766720253009
" indeed ! "	7.158220809574148
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .	2.426655126779164
" i hope not so .	5.44480800132662
" yes , almost every day . "	3.5289118788219804
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "	2.935414905780156
but at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey .	2.9845460789234917
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	2.178602796747483
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .	3.538532331994427
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	2.6965460107061
" upon my word , " said mrs . gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	3.5479042783875387
" if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it . "	2.7077632294257814
" to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart .	2.4122526812262977
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	2.243329704295626
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . "	4.899112970587309
mrs . gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . darcy by character perfectly well .	3.0525445038886607
" i see no occasion for that .	3.992568589534252
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs . f . but no one can throw any blame on them .	2.759525126368085
" very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--but _now_ we may be silent . "	1.8507026079593154
" where is your sister ? "	5.583951076004462
cried he .	19.983932366476058
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .	4.300310933894963
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	3.284703242721783
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr . darcy might have done as well . "	2.608614551147931
i speak nothing but the truth .	5.423480370254729
" has your governess left you ? "	3.9139850013200967
" this account then is what he has received from mr . darcy .	3.5810131305260837
believe her to be deceived by all means .	5.4473258481871305
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	2.3037264175019256
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .	3.125235302669666
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "	3.43138935322062
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	2.178882368242592
" of whom does jane ever think ill ?	3.562527542541349
he had never had the slightest suspicion .	4.358205529484293
poor jane !	19.270122699930788
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	2.54508731785117
but you are always giving _her_ the preference . "	3.4471165455549033
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .	3.3599564220595872
till this moment , i never knew myself . "	4.5196262706590264
i shall see her in january .	4.682002493278787
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	2.295213514665217
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again .	3.985518481513739
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .	1.8530914098608735
" it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .	3.218177535261678
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .	3.9069337685621486
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	2.764670817021777
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	2.8197848544027106
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	2.702791740177224
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	2.5473251201570086
what will you think of my vanity ?	5.0599156426564855
but these are not jane's feelings ; she is not acting by design .	3.054235154851179
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	2.516574377477603
this cannot be!--engaged to mr . darcy !	5.692996641763644
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	2.631981546974086
" if one could but go to brighton ! "	3.073184829501042
" you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	2.6943236631790684
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . "	2.4030069309069124
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	3.3645316813312824
and poor mr . darcy !	8.986361616766873
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	2.7367677340563783
" i dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "	3.3942514323747033
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	2.961540391601055
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "	2.44212660338252
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered,--what could it mean ?	3.042573798039343
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	2.677471281444685
" may we take my uncle's letter to read to her ? "	2.7727341578953792
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	2.5773847611867273
" were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr . collins very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	2.949336692096243
it is every way horrible ! "	3.99709997806372
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	3.425734994899367
mrs . bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr . bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	2.900144874796601
mr . hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	3.0816493276240062
oh , no . "	7.570211755918289
" oh !	4.947216533565322
mrs . collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	2.728531874149263
said she .	11.862111320090186
on saturday he came again .	5.585447589445162
sir william , how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr . collins wants to marry lizzy ? "	3.214374018359818
" what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr . darcy had much better finish his letter . "	3.319206296468334
thought she .	24.746588482386816
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she .	4.076982783446646
" but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "	2.212969620062682
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	3.517667869888374
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	3.0821898454342347
" mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library . "	2.204183092318716
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	2.8040777062908466
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . "	2.17961389489641
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	3.141488136929166
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .	2.4935005458110604
" it is evident by this , " added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . "	3.37345692036473
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	2.159237605267506
elizabeth made no answer .	5.858956321705367
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	2.494643444249205
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	2.4644258458314026
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	4.5633095911815795
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .	2.935855461541632
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "	2.4025682760871585
you must not suspect me .	5.622434656601164
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	2.1519807455454605
while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st . james's .	2.2367819964809397
international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states .	2.056969899667842
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	2.146914910945464
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	2.4605539937709833
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	2.631665093006371
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library . "	2.3960608193245796
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	2.617796782974951
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	3.191611182137779
" my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour .	2.863411390589602
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr . wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	2.5114117573362025
but she would not be secure .	6.860165220572293
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare . "	2.532714277484604
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	2.1609891000788592
" if he wants our society , let him seek it .	2.854672569752742
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal . "	2.9397169956579177
" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "	2.5692150827838804
" i cannot make him out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could.--can he be a sensible man , sir ? "	1.971413334967252
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	2.575126880029743
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud . "	3.0842361824140494
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	2.643076476418936
stay , stay , i will go myself .	5.718717153743754
oh , lydia ! "	6.853633239218264
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	2.255374871933427
" no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else . "	2.1123766619003934
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "	2.925064832294696
such was miss lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .	2.374757242081695
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr . bingley--is not he ?	3.555115594071853
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	2.33721738261895
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3 .	2.1094730058519606
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .	3.1013375442179765
her father lifted up his eyes .	4.403242781462386
my mind was more agreeably engaged .	4.8854695043108345
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	3.8284048916687725
what is it you are talking of ?	3.8235094937444023
" colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	2.506520955428374
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr . bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	2.41855733981402
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	3.2347030487513657
miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	3.019641443973156
mr . bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . "	2.498959159227747
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	3.046647653121527
a little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better . "	2.748397371830378
wickham's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia's for him .	3.004518835161123
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	3.2703624967732794
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	2.464259974590217
i am afraid you will be angry . "	4.362911572925441
they were natural and just .	5.353601759201134
he has not an ill-natured look .	5.10289163653267
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs . forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	2.7575397598140765
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected .	3.102189519844559
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	2.153997716416838
mr . wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	2.5980626535561235
" now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table .	3.1167957633370524
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	4.220140207434428
" no , i believe not . "	4.7594299186660525
" you may depend upon my not mentioning it . "	2.5109922836680956
james's ? "	23.163487286365164
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? "	3.048812253625672
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? "	2.103513783153299
darcy!--and so it does i vow .	4.935770800065728
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	3.0532611065594693
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .	2.6874404823662306
" let her be called down .	4.970528145532243
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	4.259555965423748
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	2.42637743905092
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !	3.641549784758233
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	2.4840824039895955
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs . bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	2.523551874823734
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	2.450658259406699
by tea-time however the dose had been enough , and mr . bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	2.7670859187145864
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	2.2577989994011487
" pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr . collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	2.6636008714203743
when tea was over , mr . hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain .	3.3008121178798997
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	2.8275871923043767
i have not _that_ pain .	5.518629813865372
bingley.--it was an animating subject , and mrs . bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	3.164207048074275
ten thousand a year !	7.919940254876893
" that it ought not to be attempted .	5.475624693425734
" we can all plague and punish one another .	3.1676929929729
" i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	2.819998505040208
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go .	3.5467729578707554
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	2.4000219601969333
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ .	2.51826748011185
" i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice .	3.7664450997703183
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	2.050461760974976
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	3.151952449166617
why is not every body as happy ? "	3.8231322009506594
let us hope for better things .	4.041557933133
" it did .	10.888113446148173
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income .	3.616400107453675
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "	2.24840676807657
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr . darcy in a most infamous manner .	2.8347786452418866
darcy . "	11.570328720106236
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .	3.5362493605390757
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .	2.8507246464679996
mrs . bennet was quite in the fidgets .	3.5633785328586494
how unlucky !	21.875009142718522
" do not you want to know who has taken it ? "	3.126761479244931
" no , indeed , i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections .	3.5188117129438163

chapter xviii .	11.504358223205136
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	3.7523067311559526
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give .	2.1533231152154144
" certainly , " replied elizabeth--"there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ .	3.8858033475322538
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	3.1644114872307068
cried elizabeth .	10.329309900021203
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	2.8457536681783457
" my dear , dear lydia ! "	3.8666758704487108
cried he , turning towards her .	5.063510369422974
mrs . wickham !	13.65515893246081
" i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "	2.989227918886248
i know no harm of her . "	3.9490976093534775
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	3.521031741272621
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "	3.6958385515181607
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "	2.4702930090624613
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ?	3.360798653831257
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "	3.1576054318225824
oh , that i knew how it was ! "	5.256568774416752
repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "	3.186326133035422
" upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself . "	2.2070224565301264
he does not want abilities .	7.502613319835907
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	3.4411157404058006
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .	2.328593872883461
1.c .	104.36077079776408
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	2.9855765160029644
" not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . "	2.6089509296599513
" oh , no ! "	5.2779692044903825
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	2.577104613308064
" none at all .	6.909020162559021
" oh !	4.947216533565322
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "	5.041239009738483
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . "	2.252358385126653
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	2.5029880904728476
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy . "	2.487938937914619
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	2.2886098687454215
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr . bingley might like you the best of the party . "	2.5410643419244434
if mr . darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	2.7831858155454308
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	3.4769181992329488
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	2.173679691740896
" it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to think . "	2.659347974158964
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	2.1788518652922746
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "	2.447923596752112
chapter xi .	11.504358223205136
it is a nice long walk , and mr . darcy has never seen the view . "	3.41310173020194
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	2.9297100282157174
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	2.2451937544112712
" la !	12.104677427021016
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr . bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	2.587292509481858

" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	2.494521761000342
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	2.5110887459692477
charles , when you build _your_ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley . "	2.7991145475333945
" and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ?	3.3770368859985864
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . darcy returned within the stated time .	2.4097992879871217
elizabeth was distressed .	9.214189223390694
how rich and how great you will be !	4.826333313243128
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	3.6975548623914007
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . darcy's sister , as , by wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	2.6801281051066357
the possibility of mr . collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . collins !	2.6178453070287797
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .	3.134693603511686
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "	3.2723611898974956
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "	2.680183168992601
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	2.631388051338404
my dear mr . bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	3.280659194084826
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	2.8800697718258177
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .	3.3224305214218166

a person may be proud without being vain .	3.7176818276056847
mr . darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	2.477980544712098
" what think you of books ? "	3.903531891999973
they then went away .	7.465567548660218
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .	3.6525742786922812
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .	2.4557555284302737
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	3.7402878698416133
" she is so fond of mrs . forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away !	3.436921718888236
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	4.04402930644976
he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	2.7776923238194584

" your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you .	3.129947899746439
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs . bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .	2.5073929281153187
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	3.1832396477379374
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	2.106660329687938
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .	3.114890890901595
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	4.0357140319283955
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "	2.949643126208852
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	2.2587242951059476
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	2.421420490462142
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "	3.1447883249394124
" if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	3.1656223000225947
she was sorry that mr . darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	2.3078666492931275
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	3.231726626712157
" how strange ! "	6.077329944238891
" mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "	2.994972107120214
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	2.620256656756838
" upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	2.866408113980496
dear me !	14.260820423973183
let me hear from you very soon .	4.24622567997712
mrs . jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	2.195092694185573
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	2.9746296532167897
we had better not mention it .	4.566662228241636
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .	2.769714929963608
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house .	2.9260829061338973
" we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	2.7558512839629485
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "	2.940787399006959
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	2.657629038834436
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	3.424688917462573
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr . bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	4.289905975264397
chapter vi .	11.504358223205136
" yes , i have had a letter from him by express . "	3.722764682085718
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say .	3.750913344282018
" i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen .	2.8353984490241104
yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .	2.565564241295656
but before they heard again from mr . gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	2.55031800373094
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?	2.517082441352085
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	2.985785225440812
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; " who can it be ? "	3.469959754954902
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	2.4250385504001963
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , " come , mr . wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	2.791973027346502
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "	2.8844509785168313
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all .	4.755008278262135
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .	5.023472050000097
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "	3.1386222367318415
" is he married or single ? "	3.8906646214707283
" you are uniformly charming ! "	3.902717784731046
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	1.9433072298055112
" i never heard that it was . "	4.485681636968469
" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "	2.8116835808805716
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs . gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	2.720174944161366
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	2.5013310089811878
my feelings will not be repressed .	6.662996960454921
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	2.3328804155529297
when mr . bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .	3.0834062797537927
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .	2.7052034642851686
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	5.086861135650777
thank heaven !	21.179481152475095
said he ; " that is rather singular . "	4.5363839287687595
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	2.597582460792319
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	4.1674407014622386
he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "	2.2557121478429223
" i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	3.398621182034638
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	3.0409778880498997
i see the imprudence of it.--oh !	5.077252158049212
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister .	3.8830175371391262
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	2.7444868920218726
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s . unless a copyright notice is included .	2.02737995585213
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	4.727971589500134
my poor father !	10.345698855174112
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	2.393684345767248
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !	2.621796283667061
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	2.504174667130174
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	3.464453114055946
why did she come ?	7.036601588595878
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	2.240926848985545
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner:-- " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	2.599505594255656
" no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose .	3.9347587195234643
she will make him a very proper wife . "	3.7659097852388737
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	3.8042610166147433
" you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "	2.70692833781471
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	2.393295804278968
he knows where we live .	5.522156566257073
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases . "	4.083124171284366
--said jane as she finished it .	6.02936071425068
never mind miss lizzy's hair . "	4.2264534102206435
" my dear sir , " replied mr . collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence . "	2.77472869788278
chapter xiii .	11.504358223205136
it cannot last long .	6.838641571875867
" yes , she did . "	5.101872721636805
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "	2.548523615728691
" he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam .	3.713590825005135
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .	3.2799823859084167
but i have other provocations .	5.364960224355181
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	2.6145344194851177
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	2.549304363344583
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr . darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	3.3987495870353994
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	2.4460526830233977
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	3.19938087880365
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "	2.8640535085733556
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	4.152244381036954
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	2.8433459185567105
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .	3.1783645272859884
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "	3.4468673554942857
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	2.1603659790867527
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	2.789553614453156
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	3.12748588041876
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	4.1434188429991545
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her-- " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "	2.3009778001909784
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in . "	3.258149628085446
elizabeth had settled it that mr . darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	2.788803934873546
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	3.394559609326183
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire . "	3.0887342084917218
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	2.8146295652705544
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "	2.743409978513901
" no , no , nonsense , lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are . "	2.5392414966956838
let me do it without farther loss of time .	3.62548270400441
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	2.6941609837043337
if , indeed , it should be so !	7.0958005829078825
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	2.362508330077285
mr . darcy danced only once with mrs . hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	2.740551323954117
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "	3.243059586230301
the period of expectation was now doubled .	4.431179356288678
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	2.709582661532977
chapter xi .	11.504358223205136
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	2.73605352257583
dear , dear lizzy .	10.013264775355143
if you love mr . darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .	4.013308440391836
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	2.5949512021925294
" may i ask to what these questions tend ? "	3.138744769641113
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .	4.793313703238294
and to see dear wickham too !	4.936958077627466
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	3.605953765716365
chapter v . every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	2.4544747186573335
" i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "	2.806180369127591
we had better go into the avenue . "	3.6780550097752647
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	4.708373904775727
the business was therefore soon settled .	4.881212608963529
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .	2.44004271531797
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !	3.8315733915913985
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	3.420134597263331
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	1.7234165517512754
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	2.443618685652506
i promised them so faithfully !	5.544951545549771
let her go then .	8.913019932365785
see paragraph 1.e below .	6.916287187153508
it originated in mrs . gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	2.4975413058054894
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	3.147353267045797
mr . gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	3.0282307291264297
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	3.3062975412237403
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain . "	2.31832546668031
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	2.5542174588107485
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	3.239453573078089
" thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . "	3.653719077272442
" i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him . "	2.996677880402488
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	2.8173966855882333
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	2.041065174850552
" i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom !	3.896365512008189
is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "	2.8566422913537792
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone .	2.1966168846076686
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	3.091040351782234
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	3.8134426823599545
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs . hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "	2.5662553415131883
" books--oh !	21.561088194141675
" oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "	2.6794532628863856
at present i am not in love with mr . wickham ; no , i certainly am not .	4.1585659766796885
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	2.944551053270148
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley's way . "	3.617137163747205
" is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? "	3.8664946756606873
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	2.36852188141015
" a man who has once been refused !	3.4767575010913463
chapter xx .	20.50194744890955
" good heaven !	7.152029542122883
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction .	2.5125049355021547
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	3.8762440458199166
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	2.6093044606558142
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .	2.7725027708191967
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	3.0582896687093073
" i desire you will do no such thing .	3.675575269900693
they had long wished to see him .	4.711565013064404
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	2.9126680774930604
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	2.386434965664394
mrs . bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .	2.394250472299745
and what can _he_ have to say ? "	3.493231665753365
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ? "	3.3261010130084654
these recollections will not do at all .	5.125391669183847
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . "	3.196601560804091
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	2.1890399720105744
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	2.3008065338554617
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's .	2.9599552061852834
elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	2.770991704294881
" yes--if darcy does not put it off again .	3.6209050205757953
i send no compliments to your mother .	4.803142016651151
elizabeth now began to revive .	5.365540776049685
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	2.8540018395548397
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	2.3326732473032363
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	2.4799844819198906
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? "	2.882620313567112
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	2.6221012012284506
" aye--that is because you have the right disposition .	3.7592521205055065
it was lady catherine de bourgh .	5.032976629785692
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it .	3.908509055078641
i am not romantic you know .	4.555580917506824
how i wanted you ! "	4.786865255350085
" it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	2.9972386730509317
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr .	2.9080427824414268
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . darcy and herself .	2.5590041842801177
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .	3.1113282941433207
they must have seen them together for ever . "	3.85295069568808
mr . darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	4.434135621865511
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	2.1029334813100475
oh !	19.31992947065936
" impossible , mr . bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "	3.4775342419084745
" and do you impute it to either of those ? "	2.7638556097033486
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "	2.5200650057791676
" how nicely we are crammed in ! "	3.136328332897829
i am not qualified to form one .	3.945884948928396
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings .	2.7621159798343933
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	3.025418396026934
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again !	3.1527344984765002
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	4.319860386432848
and one of my own daughters .	8.559154822730443
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us .	2.8003989984728945
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	3.023603251802412
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	3.5359928671897345
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?	3.4255495923236303
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	3.605400535280923
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? "	2.4297760840775524
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	3.100138816157873
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . "	2.3671977591912623
" well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	3.4146057951741873
i do not wish to avoid the walk .	5.168864957611161
but i will no longer importune my young cousin . "	2.8493676645728367
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	3.06948684504868
chapter ix .	13.68867928861669
" well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	3.5905988318737743
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .	2.3724929393779823
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	2.620286943111866
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	2.630517172526471

the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	2.431268531264194
what do i not owe you !	4.717057763744702
" i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . "	2.954914686604442
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "	2.734299460041388
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . "	2.7651412365409596
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	2.3822466560507833
can i speak plainer ?	7.54200462466916
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	3.540584843975693
lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	2.257545029712175
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	3.6170167246040186
darcy_ , you see , is the man !	5.591770387756166
she is almost three and twenty !	4.7884150905836504
it is of no consequence .	5.4711324245799
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	2.8786682683237528
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "	2.3458036087370027
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1 .	2.3938242366853526
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	2.8838544631548078
the next was in these words .	5.415516048668749

my temper would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "	2.113399152874406
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs . collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	2.912148517549012
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	4.053847887460905
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "	3.2631044260225925
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "	2.359776648696985
they had frequently been staying with her in town .	3.69513777706302
" yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be .	3.3907825024693112
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	4.152949983413167
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	2.818571121479331
mr . bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	2.3299822459419026
" yes , very handsome . "	3.9551920926487356
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her .	2.347442944664138
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .	2.78533696930181
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : m^{rs } ) .	2.275348767463379
mrs . bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	2.3453802905898367
" it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "	2.6499970907352535
yes .	94.16797956498651
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings .	3.486535239516352
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	2.766426506151429
consider mr . collins's respectability , and charlotte's prudent , steady character .	3.2685276221829462
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	5.217186874755098
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "	2.27750370275163
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	2.4739121497006717
mrs . bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .	1.9926870861880615
when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	2.4962775825113157

the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .	2.6383937092367185
" i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder .	3.209009321644061
elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	3.0671166780696963
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations .	3.830884246577898
" that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .	2.8349508515423034
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	3.1403088775567127
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not . "	3.246226654038394
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton .	2.383079490625588
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height , or rather taller . "	2.5052645159770774
mr . darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	4.285804559043567
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	2.962151407174183
" and i certainly _never_ shall give it .	3.800555295961475
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success .	2.4321353573503943
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design .	2.5314068373969705
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	2.3430917995285747
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows:-- " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	2.2932891709839023
" their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .	2.840628548152208
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "	2.445164201332675
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	2.4332541388684112
you have no compassion on my poor nerves . "	3.3887862702818006
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	3.308253968797642
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	4.920706834772095
mrs . philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs . philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar .	2.502228797104217
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .	3.2050295148399774
they will have nothing else to do . "	3.9443644518327816
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window--she looked,--she saw mr . darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	3.014802531591134
and his answering immediately to the last question--oh !	4.148859295022402
bennet . "	20.497100945899238
do not repeat what i then said .	4.274172441975417
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	2.7406266232136525
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . "	2.3905449354326294
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .	2.521974439555592
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	3.0822860522205633
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! "	2.9039569366267113
so tall!--oh , my dear lizzy !	7.9148525671389605
mr . darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .	3.2910165878192474
1.f.5 .	104.36077079776408
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr . collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . bennet were dead .	2.7748511383827386
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .	2.99552792148921
she cried .	14.243573202858558
" gracechurch-street , monday , august 2 .	3.7958057623927086
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . collins .	5.051359228396683
" oh !	4.947216533565322
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .	3.4130354964597553
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	2.4208719114970716
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	3.8783647542381527
" yes , sir , i know i am .	4.914371620946569
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	4.466253360135904
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	6.016080456662656
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn .	2.4250229076953964
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	2.6413865769363642
you deserve no such attention .	5.749034082439133
" and what is your success ? "	4.072406239375451
" who do you mean , my dear ?	6.597556729784104
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .	3.7604105517727366
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . "	3.0952657873113476
" dear madam , " cried mrs . hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from mr . gardiner ?	2.84399070099592
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "	2.9004784441884395
mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	2.591524258013519
1.f.3 .	106.40546012463051
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .	2.4141104123995984
her colour changed , and she said no more .	4.724136924995681
" gracechurch-street , sept . 6 .	3.972055547517454
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	2.9722658049236768
and , above all things , keep mr . bennet from fighting .	3.7537266314095215
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	2.6864912777774195
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	4.622713317580914
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	3.0320104990549925
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family . "	2.4970527421928006
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated .	2.1227453467990625
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	2.446819785815002
" no , " said her father , " wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	2.7790479920020217
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ .	2.539726959291751
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth .	2.67028487880327
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	3.2155969063443988
" yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	2.6250424838387594
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	2.4825747404497975
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "	2.052093044210455
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	2.534331631793496
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter .	6.071750163082718
but what does he say of the living ? "	3.680345298067917
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--mr .	2.077790265548254
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together .	2.868872637343407
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam .	3.579775905815444
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .	3.192512026373712
" i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want . "	3.010051950513981
mr . gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street .	2.5673083350637307
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	3.207412931192229
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	3.3310746223204837
you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him . "	3.033946594996611
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	2.7847334859183084
mrs . bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	2.3301229434679103
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	2.159567392635084
to put me on my guard ?	4.99019995405024
" this will not do , " said elizabeth .	5.102156376405887
as for their mother , mr . collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	2.9057495606124144
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	2.9081140993753456
mr . bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	2.2092534900395258
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . collins .	3.5546264253361866
while sir william was with them , mr . collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	2.264481546962709
but mr . gardiner could not be seen , and mr . darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	3.570596275601678
but so they always are .	5.876146541898441
" if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think . "	3.1644578656065305
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	2.3079813925536103
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .	2.841537931987077
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	2.639894029780898
" you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "	2.1799975660080797
said elizabeth .	11.538449393955492
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	3.0263147098524388
it would be dreadful !	9.995614212388839
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "	3.537842625468947
mr . gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .	3.020650919077529
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	2.620259107408245
you alluded to something else .	5.352284796908344
" there is nothing the matter with me .	3.8223582607373547
darcy!--there is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "	2.5857159605706452
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	2.7647752747645407
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	3.2104039393565684
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "	2.3506380732774694
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !	3.115037511174895
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	3.331253630366726
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	2.753827636207362
mrs . bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "	2.8790214160415384
what say you , mary ?	6.738695273025928
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the trouble of practising .	3.248724558372767
good bye . "	7.374612396141568
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	2.9807754460276596
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	2.5922535828200055
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "	3.5560861148205656
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .	3.082769308443937
there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr . darcy could have such boundless influence .	3.200207215788076
" let me be rightly understood .	4.204401486983174
" mr . darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	2.985453812644639
" my dear mr . bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome !	3.349077924161051
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "	2.3206036976888793
" don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven's sake !	3.3221039373626104
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	3.093193705678005
project gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks , unless you receive specific permission .	2.422862472720171
" does that young lady know mr .	4.261946053197366
" how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr . darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved . "	2.4642460323416455
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	2.9845785100542863
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr . bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	3.005552671304243
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	2.85793909424193
what will become of me .	5.330049435184107
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	3.3556517981889167
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .	4.221331386515538
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .	2.5254023155435257
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	2.400605151695917
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	2.99417976418831
the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . darcy could not have .	2.4988571305787133
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	2.7232973549844606
" and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !	3.251935780536732
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	3.1569976702763336
sir william only smiled .	7.061227501668733
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	2.3836142767439297
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	3.4565216832607937
why any fear of detection ?	5.902004074030835
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	2.3321918492560143
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	3.6053967315102504
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	4.024134797376512
society , i own , is necessary to me .	3.8598531388490667
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr . darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	2.755878898236576
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did .	2.851160366595606
" with the officers ! "	5.83497622328677
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	3.8971165460818047
" are you not diverted ? "	4.209195083521728
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	2.0829260792606057
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	2.551381340518933
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . "	3.118036127072531
--and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	3.2509963440191485
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell .	2.895362816132429
what is to become of us !	4.898270457785669
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	2.422392191267584
" what will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are !	3.0556711527861684
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . "	3.3044342484238975
" but how did he account for it ? "	3.5226002165139554
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair .	4.888183184723157
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl's younger son ?	2.7401082355984765
why must their marriage be private ?	4.2547018441202
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	3.1471626407666324
mr . wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .	2.2864070636779905
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr . collins's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go--saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . "	2.4822970484737334
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "	2.27419613452551
but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud.--as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	2.585438147279412
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "	2.386772255177237
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "	3.161525296160379
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	2.8119391748076255
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	3.063710640434612
mrs . bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	2.9641532412398117
added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "	3.1933518072321854
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "	2.985420102842575
" i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth .	4.954686833505463
very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	2.597023135447365
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	3.6159567825532344
mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	3.6967140589137477
she will follow wherever lydia leads .	4.18444383236102
however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	2.291205227698757
" i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	2.4422506268913406
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	3.256095033480563
" shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "	2.80323569396172
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	2.1504579286024574
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	2.497603595385099
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "	2.1806817443798567
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	2.9154987565138577
what is it about ?	7.309877587420574
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	2.7564308081270292
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	2.8666747335688165
" you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "	3.2591651345662775
she cried.--"i , who have prided myself on my discernment!--i , who have valued myself on my abilities !	2.777284885358862
" i cannot believe it .	5.495537507628942
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	2.092420077537898
" this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .	3.3301105290865407
* * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	2.5634079913215824
two days after mr . bennet's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . "	2.5473939148440614
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends . "	2.789829351227089
" thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	2.8874123462542034
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	2.5945085019347625
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater--what shall i call it ?	2.958345781766035
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	2.1025345552323347
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me .	2.4767261341150584

mr . collins made his declaration in form .	3.794409446853468
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him !	2.2070945915546614

to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	2.892074201278348
his words seemed to imply it .	4.38900608466401
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	2.7349216112533314
another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	3.0608728944994157
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .	2.475686543597877
i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him .	3.6203334771500764
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .	2.731880588763315
" oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant , does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	2.144070415115977
" a little . "	6.225049112317715
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . and mrs . gardiner , though unknown .	2.6839955101609356
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	2.271141748922567
" i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think . "	3.052230988573143
" have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	3.2484466763987316
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "	3.711482023176849
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "	2.9136448603961735
" yes , very well .	4.733272493312714
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .	2.60525524370691
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2.5154041512998644
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	2.9938107814059305
we do not suffer by _accident_ .	4.6988712562614925
" only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "	3.0269061404566977
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good .	3.1965133443669522
bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	2.279973515378023
" are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "	2.4633816601816716
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs .	3.0396734254191733
cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !	3.055215620964153
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "	2.523774717461913
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .	2.9912432981281305
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	2.4323433190407426
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_ .	5.4209224940907195
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .	2.422009865681937
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	3.264016870575787
" i should never have said mrs . collins was settled _near_ her family . "	3.6147847016571912
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance .	2.4461821447411496
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open .	2.610419510850263
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , william collins . "	2.3373989306700076
mrs . bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	2.290294072505551
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	2.7911056578166953
cried lydia .	14.64220679590336
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all mr . collins's scruples of leaving mr . and mrs . bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that mr . wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	2.5504734155178346
1.f.4 .	104.36077079776408
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .	2.2543417291110686
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	2.7534537434860646
were questions with which she amused herself .	4.427549221432963
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr .	2.965173778831957
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "	2.9325086132970304
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	3.3133229394376675
what relates to yourself , is as follows .	3.9808410113582786
i know not what to think .	4.51674851912758
make haste , make haste .	7.242312184850049
i am impatient to see him . "	4.562456097108397
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	2.314895765616386
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	3.4018254881401866
chapter vi .	11.504358223205136
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	2.0602509139710503
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .	4.037361009414683
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	3.164233519910814
" do you prefer reading to cards ? "	3.1466113221344583
i shall like it of all things .	4.801321335807102
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	2.5241234848024323
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	4.9207791779468835
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	2.9347669461064556
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	2.264539393084169
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs . younge was of course removed from her charge .	2.786378132803663
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	2.20054446691236
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "	2.77184402846068
but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world . "	2.3628167261733495
" oh , yes .	5.696628817802294
" yes--but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "	3.337230079127252
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .	3.8288409725205024
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character .	3.1214517212888855
" this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	3.4229935652472108
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr .	2.5031121736395243
" the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "	3.3148687018207337
i am so grieved for him .	4.637819259128624
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "	3.7070776066793596
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	2.309971391536258
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr . bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit .	2.5282955613053395
chapter vii .	13.68867928861669
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . "	3.077786143872189
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	5.366592569786908
section 2 .	20.47463490768659
--it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	4.507009965017537
" oh , lizzy !	5.90179610563383
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	2.9779567790503845
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	2.249632136697495
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	3.698348150023956
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	5.716343972235525
many small donations ( $1 to $5,000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs .	2.033050390901957
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied . "	2.8431488095539126
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . "	2.414975201524918
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	2.619114296159812
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	3.177680789261227
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived .	3.8273065336596868
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "	2.6850408949017646
the strangeness of mr . collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	2.933278237993476
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .	2.759474022641635
" are you quite sure , ma'am?--is not there a little mistake ? "	2.6161591956324344
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	2.7549908660458757
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .	2.94542122897942
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	3.7562609410864964
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "	2.4160811463877607
such a countenance , such manners !	4.685106979095622
" i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "	3.273436727904105
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	3.0773401640244535
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !	3.3205871054244533
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	2.5561227292466193
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him .	4.069046724429591
mrs . bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	2.709877055598445
" good gracious ! "	4.28481251103745
do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .	2.065719433310579
had it been your uncle's doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	2.3678485285101845
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	3.4926880303793983
" certainly not . "	6.151657358142039
but are you pleased , jane ?	5.543394003734594
i write rather slowly . "	5.490231840437837
" if !	19.79277612057508
" and have you heard from him often ? "	3.3448184420362628
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	2.706594037327185
yet , indeed , i am in earnest .	8.1448588469367
is not this an agreeable surprise ? "	4.16223439874209
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	3.1318641957933777
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	3.2632171388811355
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	2.4198510379737823
" and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	2.807871723398603
said jane .	24.420027436977403
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure .	6.710498783340046
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "	3.1669130683953024
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says .	2.9985368625243938
1813 .	43.86690853635113
if i could but see _you_ as happy !	4.232223472964531
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . "	2.1942637019049354
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	2.8051356401931202
" do you really think so ? "	3.932422943247457
cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted .	5.752634000826476
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .	2.6170916533167787
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	3.275307557003885
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	2.5875838204966106
chapter xv .	13.68867928861669
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "	3.4088087806094927
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	3.6739798217647066
bennet.--they had several children .	7.577122400135328
" perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?	2.6793824256963243
darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--yet it did , and even a third .	2.22664725356902
i never saw such a long chin in my life .	3.6403445481100474
chapter viii .	11.504358223205136
" i did not think you would;--and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion . "	2.588340751687732
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza . "	2.8045519817771494
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "	2.372622604853139
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "	3.4389541268366455
at present i will say nothing about it . "	2.817925488472023
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	2.7461953470137987
yes , yes .	11.489508343221347
but do not be cast down .	5.039672779035091
but you do not know _all_ .	8.126706569227574
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .	2.8894556026267053
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "	3.14036682681518
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "	2.3469990655857145
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	2.3498384064176885
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	2.4934599783665727
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again .	3.2991863730033675
" the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "	2.237982463924758
" his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . darcy's steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself . "	2.7759695215801217
his daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative .	2.467924996217099
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	3.4338038454858792
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr . wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	2.169881463172308
--she could have added , " a young man too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner ! "	2.4031569715270202
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs . bingley and talked of mrs . darcy may be guessed .	3.0900053642942273
mr . collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	2.7629238128543525
mr . darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	3.667548626515399
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	3.2911450160987026
bingley met them with hopes that mrs . bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .	3.0089885327555406
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	2.319397386841551
how are they even to be discovered ?	4.397076051975743
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king .	2.398154095722311
this was very amiable , but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr . collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	2.1338407919097495
all field sports were over .	5.255469229573775
three daughters married !	13.290973976903116
all were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	2.04042257329888
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , '_she_ a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	2.5313206915163633
mr . darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .	2.4742936646422713
chapter xxi .	20.50194744890955
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr . darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	2.8077443774185804
mr . gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	4.246648513139318
" bingley . "	10.495577131501719
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .	2.7841599327226065
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	2.1695048216120623
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her .	2.4919283834495785
" they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "	2.4203774965941736
" _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said mr . darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet .	3.4634198156882965
my father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	2.381159869137129
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "	2.0667410275286646
but as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you .	2.97721314261869
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .	3.3163320473035984
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "	3.2441761742170914
" i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .	2.7592166815131716
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	2.997516373187234
he was most highly esteemed by mr . darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	3.375061476106577
there was no want of discourse .	5.086803223962323
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	2.6981791381898126
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	4.424035044233249
" they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "	3.04716547708266
elizabeth replied that it was .	7.869080372586658
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "	3.1641952070093073
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "	2.7319883978530126
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ?	3.1751265931037467
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	3.0310424873588238
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	2.4220353987013903
they have at least that advantage . "	4.119778526289181
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .	2.967810865191703
mrs . philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr . jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr . collins by jane's introduction of him .	2.5274833158324586
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months .	3.1590222977324633
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .	2.3621197015898923
" with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it . "	2.4648344475496238
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .	3.615457134242222
" oh !	4.947216533565322
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	3.7755271937030113
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach .	2.4275372600589193
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	2.833427037124207
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	2.8554350581833035
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come .	1.912987577957731
it was all conjecture . "	5.165112119299317
" though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "	2.3211499706776926
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	2.248822349657302
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	2.47789249534602
" oh !	4.947216533565322
chapter xix .	11.504358223205136
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	2.8888086815909246
their fortune on both sides is splendid .	3.9841722336221053
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	2.72391908507345
mr . gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	3.0608164780798996
" from mr . collins !	10.581300303176803
" i have , sir . "	4.787166630478372
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley's continued absence .	3.378455382247912
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	3.4748060271323595
what is your own opinion ? "	4.985768918836963
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	2.491725974544296
it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened .	2.576629857872632
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	4.41633361524836
1.e.3 .	104.36077079776408
her ladyship was highly incensed .	5.898632032758319
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	3.8843207372160564
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	2.205944780785855
" oh !	4.947216533565322
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	2.4072342668961824
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter .	3.004632753895157

it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "	2.0666985813747383
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .	2.99045387179066
" your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .	2.180036715028332
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	3.9341994035661925
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise . "	3.103529955346667
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun . "	3.034882361910346
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	2.0399327006117076
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	2.5281059660758567
" remember , eliza , that he does not know jane's disposition as you do . "	4.144142542957825
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	2.932197459481252
when is your turn to come ?	4.9841410924965155
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	2.410960071575665
" no , " replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	4.2366432114076655
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	2.2956076926583155
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr . bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	3.1287271563336
" of music !	10.621563474130527
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr . bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	2.478241736095187
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	2.416552114057389
four nieces of mrs . jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	2.9560239781002937
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	2.954247858726385
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	2.653979931772872
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the rules is very easy .	2.4835854085878717
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	2.5870043345674363
" what could become of mr . bingley and jane ! "	4.30175597420531
" i am sorry it went off .	3.453648723886069
" unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . "	2.8729368313721197
" lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . "	3.2387048906589686
poor little lizzy !	10.351797605550729
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	3.782430430270855
i understand that mr . collins has made you an offer of marriage .	4.394412993521604
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	3.06372786497337
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "	2.3496662842120446
but the gentlemen will have mr . bingley's chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs . "	2.871956033200263
" oh !	4.947216533565322
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .	2.5961462908625674
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	3.3635402271862396
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	2.2954594031464186
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	2.408924192144429
" let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "	3.3836555601709075
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	2.62289742104652
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .	2.1609533258530327
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	2.534871813616297
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "	3.66745838708089
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	2.433620399305916
what are we to do ! "	4.355180232889106
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	3.1361517996707033
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . "	3.735691061571262
jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	2.514384471962832
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .	2.274032123565997
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	4.388121435635967
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	2.7411043586153436

besides , there was truth in his looks . "	4.453494001527218
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr . darcy--that mr . darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .	2.471825064804374
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .	3.419047784557412

how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	2.3444399150862294
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .	2.828257309324506
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	4.550113448523492
cried lydia .	14.64220679590336
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .	3.0090647003559288
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ? "	2.4987676332683173
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	2.67458116055902
" i never thought mr . darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do . "	3.0793021990183034
you are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself . "	3.2594779360759008
it would have suited me in every respect . "	3.9671805194905843
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .	2.751937433844846
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	2.1719502122602186
mr . bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .	2.7783881075028014
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "	2.2806374360149277
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	2.4337331450990485
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	2.089282990938355
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	2.545692663367351
" i certainly shall not .	5.894076985244628
" i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .	3.1462591585546087
you have employed your time much better .	3.8643099674041324
mr . darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- " this walk is not wide enough for our party .	2.295795262093776
he was received by mrs . bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	2.324205323362703
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "	2.8145159821414714
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was elizabeth's intimate friend .	2.681756815064051
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .	2.2692826810767874
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very ill . " " no , i thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	2.3714718475306187
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	2.2233616161161684
mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	2.1389396441414403
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	2.242164025882208
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .	2.4160099791040937
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . "	2.542638238482689
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	2.583545529932948
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	2.803121587562965
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	2.672050910002288
mr . darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	3.0398657065646533
" not yet , " replied jane .	6.686540257165969
chapter vii .	13.68867928861669
mrs . bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	2.751992060276408
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	2.4243138866461704
" have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "	2.6209026606791874
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr . darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	2.4200602390574972
" did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ?	3.314446429667984
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .	2.5847128264796333
" but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy .	3.0518385584406125
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	4.14621753212097
oh !	19.31992947065936
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	2.062310677076192
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better .	2.4592866365499932
" oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all .	3.615208740445001
in three volumes .	6.354806282472118
" at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , " said mr . bennet , as he folded up the letter .	3.2311740881601723
" _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ .	3.2313710343883675
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	2.67394467049583
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	2.3558006530008213
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	2.3437358061747933
what news ?	21.203232750367892
" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "	3.411842153811623
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	2.769763246366439
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	4.978596319674317
" oh !	4.947216533565322
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .	2.745232108274129
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	3.08729880382753
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	2.8241231749178137
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	2.710779181191191
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	2.3858190107812405
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse . "	3.277080865779407
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	2.681092899999096
" what could he mean ?	5.445257008731164
" aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "	2.6893844609493534
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p . i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .	2.5512788574902507
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	2.7425985000915123
" yes , and i had heard it before .	4.121722391340619
and do you really love him quite well enough ?	4.15933757393308
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	2.8970572795237097
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	3.004007725777744
" but depend upon it , mr . collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason .	3.155687714293035
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	2.236450745480391
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	2.6864644342408464
they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	2.496511531957145
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	2.7563560984020197
" we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	2.076542006096277
" your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .	2.872983270793897
where is your sash my dear ? "	4.19367006499581
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	2.7622507051102163
your ladyship wants mr . darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make _their_ marriage at all more probable ?	2.5029299829017315
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over.--to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed .	2.3689299638921715
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : 1.e.1 .	2.8806417888454257
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . "	3.0655537591856397
i _will_ leave him to himself . "	3.78488584411264
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	2.6230643072062323
" what can be the meaning of this ! "	3.0878541693822017
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	3.6378400017215924
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false !	3.027566304666412
his character is thereby complete . "	4.120094719984567
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .	2.8342417582865345
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	4.739730166152511
occupied in observing mr . bingley's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	3.1310092427764498
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	2.2964525788903187
how can they suit each other?--do you know mr .	2.9288242161556917
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .	2.8707435992992054
" i can easily believe it .	4.681571049583662
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .	3.1113340133599148
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing , miss bennet ? "	2.2653860175446106
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	2.4117596469926377
they are all for what they can get .	4.22400519263312
" not the slightest .	7.255318999584178
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	2.206617362178013
i am very glad you liked her .	4.0154804097942876
and what sort of table do they keep ?	3.5452937490610683
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "	3.0743148615167706
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? "	2.815979648630469
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	2.193341326751136
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	2.2950904028868475
without a governess you must have been neglected . "	4.516692612513732
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	2.4925223886487626
wickham only shook his head .	5.784807660461434
catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	2.1863187457764286
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me . "	2.338971823249077
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	2.3207398818801885
" ten thousand pounds !	10.232842714658513
but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	2.476489564735432
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	3.6361390722921874
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	2.673468648477259
" i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions . "	2.3334449114482596
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance . "	3.3926456531642013
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	2.668247427707212
" and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	2.883713275646763
mrs . bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .	3.4965638027488075
" no"--said darcy , " i have made no such pretension .	5.17049781796056
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	2.343198722642447
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	2.7081686378361125
mr . darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	3.3435730230651974
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	2.7062735136121456
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	2.380853515716178
" my uncle is to send a servant for us . "	3.2278504018342087
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	2.5268509231264136
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , " what you have learnt about mr . wickham .	3.5632646242541073
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	3.153504875907738
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	2.334852038992337
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	2.9202478400714678
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "	3.2874823918747635
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .	2.910855883057363
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .	3.586557723373466
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	3.5636596841250974
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	2.9302630338472766
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	2.3444160257090787
though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	2.9878376269587763
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ .	2.878307398883078
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	3.303878437721071
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress !	4.1154023588540465
" already arisen ! "	7.069168473560342
elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	2.6227538605526943
" pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	2.750506660172847
" kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully .	2.863819252249774
" my dear father , i congratulate you . "	3.498957381802344
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	2.52270737737353
he drew a chair near her .	4.760881971519175
" mr . bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	4.04014466729773
i have a high respect for your nerves .	3.600191874312973
" aye , there she comes , " continued mrs . bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way.--but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	2.252035160507551
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	2.8874337081596626
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters .	2.2498165128071164
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	2.4330018860338996
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? "	3.083717718149398
and what sort of young lady is she ?	3.705241154790986
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	3.3318501591439973
" but i was embarrassed . "	5.559676189415369
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease .	2.6542118137536486
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	2.7184486000378842
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .	3.0841092109111834
they will ruin your happiness .	5.101817239782713
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .	3.9248755511063056
she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh !	2.857883896515297
mrs . bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger !	3.315360899296042
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states .	2.1843752504591243
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he _did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr .	2.075835568949336
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	4.267908454157315
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .	3.2493797626498075
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "	3.491352500288816
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "	2.523721687817238
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	3.995502721147723
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	2.67624039461451
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	2.8150205596466837
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	2.2135047104879315
" she is a very fine-looking woman !	3.914774067033641
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .	2.7467842131927496
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	2.6104869072797565
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	2.0292585320545937
_they_ will never be distressed for money .	4.556186864438095
" we never had any governess . "	4.192323494874036
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . darcy's explanation _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .	2.6959049065986056
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .	2.3222431528878507
" _you_ were mr . bingley's first choice . "	3.888549255528665
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew what he was .	3.0507454186172343
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .	2.267077639203918
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .	3.947523087036174
" oh ! "	3.3178953880826065
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	2.857070236465426
" and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !	2.7678960558384227
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	3.3219080679841397
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ?	2.6762822414803726
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	2.475388085573816
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	3.7659726477368327
in revolving lady catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	2.752826777220796
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	2.6419558751857486
" she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	2.7983965820726047
" my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london . "	3.125881159209464
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	2.3958350340334063
" never , sir . "	5.780387271718259
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "	2.3574425430715977
" 'tis too much ! "	5.077416764016488
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .	3.02227867733644
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "	2.894311113768048
in a few minutes , mrs . bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "	3.3706766924496736
" oh !	4.947216533565322
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	2.7597503817933196
her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	2.4654727701770787
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .	2.7800728269902057
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged .	2.7800603556178527
what are men to rocks and mountains ?	3.558698014914635
" miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .	3.5198178937831694
mr . collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	3.3185162298244784
my father bears it better .	5.061977322683019
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	2.192127785016747
by this time she is actually with them !	4.587025390517414
elizabeth could bear it no longer .	4.585740120248157
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .	2.7629967164533626
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .	3.391748726288523
" believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .	2.3293899285479065
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	2.313726860384056
it cannot be concealed from any one .	4.411500571686525
mr . bennet protested against any description of finery .	3.429366188538296
their reception from mr . bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	4.077602987159406
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	2.618524765204691
but enough of this .	8.155694409879292
mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	3.4440558487465944
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	2.395849801916395
i dearly love a laugh . "	4.523558917603313
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	2.5190455580080875
what hours of transport we shall spend !	3.9878934574468468
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's.--do you draw ? "	2.383986918663909
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it . "	2.8329621249568744
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	2.377336379220867
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	2.5533577456401244
certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "	3.2818260860359825
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	2.39386136501919
mrs . gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	2.148743175707287
stop me whilst you can . "	4.757514279799043
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	4.024023222118447
widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	2.1205734103028018
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "	2.4094677389080297
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	2.7808241657916404
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	2.963700000184881
hear me in silence .	9.250489950677625
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	2.4793408762013005
mr . collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	3.569270228401151
on finding mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "	2.9954953681193266
mr . darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	2.612840825818781
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	2.8941687270456327
his father , miss bennet , the late mr . darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr . darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	2.9370436353920377
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you joy ? "	2.5412970599623708
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	2.7412242544168794
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	3.114813930103688
" it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .	3.5481914278364814
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "	3.3746007534086897
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .	3.999281981553351
" and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business . "	2.289197443360899
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	2.308694620397836
" i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	3.840273517560885
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	2.819257731919868
" what is his name ? "	4.416318008085016
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	3.2389545139931286
" take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "	2.503838790154512
mrs . bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .	3.1706136853518903
" my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request .	3.9184097525317783
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	2.1690724151524554
" after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	2.2237973404587392
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr . s . fairbanks , ak , 99712 . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .	1.739989788949042
" mr .	8.358865732937272
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? "	3.0558803689754246
good heaven !	19.59368204950078
this was agreed to , and mrs . philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	2.633188292632811
mr . gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	3.1443565988492237
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	3.7089123370731025
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks .	2.181229587226014
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	2.172839330890726
but , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	3.1829394886251574
" you have said quite enough , madam .	3.588197983786488
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr . darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .	2.285909230077383
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	3.0968654949050403
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?	3.456255865832682
and when i returned home , the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	2.6533719047334707
chapter xiii .	11.504358223205136
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	4.197388617207505
" la !	12.104677427021016
i appeal to mr . darcy:--but let me not interrupt you , sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "	2.0177741648609038
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	1.9358398248752136
adieu to disappointment and spleen .	5.243364991456567
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	2.705332537438826
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	2.830503889370201
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .	3.300215556849305
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .	3.602437174937883
to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	2.779523430259857
i was ready to die of laughter .	4.36375855930578
he made no answer .	6.629145058354065
" no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . "	2.6079920088402937
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought mr . wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	2.317671688667631
mr . bingley followed his advice .	5.218663806098094
" when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "	2.833057903554815
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	2.7313501129191504
miss bennet still looked all amazement .	4.524432947683374
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	3.331257824963828
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	2.4577592924487575
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	2.440449738676127
she dared not relate the other half of mr . darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	2.871264213967634
" i admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "	2.3113709621510763
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .	3.7058840236873434
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	2.874729831265273
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	1.995406717837491
but it must not , shall not be .	5.930662903649654
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	2.5125125707186675
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	2.5001504245754256
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	2.7645237314043545
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr . wickham with money . "	3.3302632846457167
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	3.8489286568448615
mrs . gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .	3.3418956350463302
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	2.303241177374665
i am so happy .	6.50855451701829
mr . collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	2.5411052630745745
it was gratitude.--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	2.170583306026891
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	2.31600770665949
but your _family_ owe me nothing .	4.400083844974581
after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	2.9515640761778483
" her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .	2.270166317495121
" yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "	3.1085062392205343
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	3.111540999860844
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "	2.808362713562575
" yes , madam , " said mrs . bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine .	3.5423092732597303
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	2.1019258040621787
mrs . bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	2.4797123558561758
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	2.3929743524825002
" perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .	3.918625243998979
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	2.946742442357321
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	3.77515591879193
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .	3.1793725559025057
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease . "	3.1102693787254743
on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .	2.3268390785399693
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	3.3580662031025565
mr . bennet could not have chosen better .	5.550177698162995
" oh !	4.947216533565322
when first mr . bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .	3.207999271276586
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	2.6724461109946547
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she .	3.886165833701373
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	3.2798983579713603
" but it is , " returned she ; " for mrs . long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "	3.1793846836821906
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	2.088811501868313
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh !	3.3591311270448254
i want to talk very seriously .	5.082823455597904
she will be down in a moment i dare say . "	4.40675944836933
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr . collins's correspondence for any consideration .	3.465199320136123
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	3.3705931498969366
" you forget that i have made no answer .	4.194636760237996
it is really too distressing .	4.706965009775647
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .	3.556398188520288
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	3.0450368235469725
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	2.424719574313138
not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	3.0148764158444767
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	3.770949747733819
they were not the only objects of mr . collins's admiration .	4.410006946375454
if this be the case , he deserves you .	4.1874786422551535
" i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	2.8417332350177364
darcy made no answer .	5.396639543603527
mr . bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .	3.20880427991918
mr . what's his name .	5.373583580004775
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	2.256849368075917
" yes , she called yesterday with her father .	3.3416524812058848
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	2.519908462765372
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he .	4.032362207856802
could there be finer symptoms ?	5.92881943486383
" i hope , my dear , " said mr . bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "	3.051241961645117
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "	2.7377952528996414
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	2.639851311497444
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year .	2.117852679217434
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	2.8476827872223813
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .	2.843971620966508
we must not make him desperate . "	4.014811890441807
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	3.2689313029199343
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	2.5521932671737524
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	2.1834041274165235
how i long to see her !	5.110128050870887
" if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins--but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards . "	2.784860783914787
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	3.018211313910048
" if he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever . "	3.3128037422705976
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "	3.2824909304162717
there is nothing he would not do for her . "	3.918120925201783
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	2.446312155037852
" i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	2.6354098970407014
" it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . "	3.109964972550022
mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	2.399992779596446
he is come--mr . bingley is come.--he is , indeed .	3.0161311060084905
what is the matter ? "	6.2065253151031206
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	2.2818160329374493
" your humility , mr . bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . "	3.294566175820526
chapter iii .	11.500047627214586
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "	2.310423464114337
it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .	3.229990874879459
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	2.623962714217251

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .	3.3709999574181917
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "	2.1070529033409944
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	2.547484211765521

from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	2.4813252111917334
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	2.65472498514
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	2.607591119373336
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	2.4284609806514217
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	2.2029842500742043
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	2.5607446213781397
and then we were so merry all the way home !	3.8553295837691812
" that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ . "	3.1357174787835116
" lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	2.952925552261451
mr . darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "	3.7731957042617643
of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	3.6428586215387626

that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner .	2.702470261393667
he is perfectly amiable .	8.19349167243172
mrs . philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire .	2.570022102305198
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	2.1638966365857804

" all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "	2.9405865498198667
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . bingley will like it lizzy . "	2.8831083098869814
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	2.1584715676162283
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	3.1245631206586277
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party .	2.932340684786134
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .	2.878161912229499
" shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? "	2.9334388907503914
other schemes too came into her head .	4.29073207681871
his brother-in-law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	2.591910157847833
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	4.21361037463869
well , he is a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	2.894233992254087
mr . collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . bennet .	2.4918105021789754

" she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property . "	2.950748679770211
mrs . bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	1.9955171797671736
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "	2.5130261264900717
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	3.2995468978716467

had the late mr . darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life .	2.494431717782062
your's , &c . " mr . darcy's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr . bennet sent to mr . collins , in reply to his last .	3.1851348351753885
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	2.9156581234525376

nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	2.4087571213813805

" oh !	4.947216533565322
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .	2.4692304255880497
mamma would like to go too of all things !	4.06348191585714
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	2.2230682522886593
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .	2.7909622603848017
how was that possible ?	7.632622271179381
pray , how _violent was_ mr . bingley's love ? "	3.592622161316757
is not it so , mrs .	5.336268053297933
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	2.28918734875549
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "	3.205741218274334
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	3.0817675791697727
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side .	2.9345125454990715
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	2.6478381196515244
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr . denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "	2.5031040113899095
and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	2.4540056466669626
" my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	3.1262541225042715
mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	3.9028043350126427
that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	2.9029469933698504
mr . darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "	2.5028633009668093
" and how impossible in others ! "	3.931221100182136
chapter xi .	11.504358223205136
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "	2.639837938856556
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs . bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	2.6273099856963595
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	2.149217176276988
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	4.090550182221136

" i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . "	2.5826953576942633
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	5.339868192637376
mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	2.73530870517522
" elizabeth , you are not serious now . "	4.890325988761935
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	2.929188277788303
i dare say the lace upon mrs . hurst's gown---- " here she was interrupted again .	2.441878295541636
she comes to us to-day .	6.014678019191462
" not that i _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "	2.798544003691299
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ . "	3.3962992314867906
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "	2.5367236941422493
by mrs . hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	2.6477549740277055
when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr . darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . bingley for his sister .	2.413866125652102
how could i be so silly as to wish it !	3.6656557177853557
well , well , i only hope it will last .	4.452050375904933
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .	2.3255768452353904
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to .	2.481550953980641
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	3.129998653649074
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	2.242480066841444
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "	3.5895947395062233
my father , however , is partial to mr . wickham .	5.950495897263246
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	3.155295022183299
bingley . "	17.992412736052156
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .	2.969586276374335
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! "	2.5030974879828007
